page_content="Um good morning, everyone.  Um, as Atif has mentioned, I am the development team  leader Luminant Solutions.  And I was just asked to come down and speak  to you all about how IOT might relate to industry.  Uh, what you can do next about work and career  choices and, uh, your next steps, uh, post degree or  post study.  So just as a quick overview, um, as was mentioned  already, I've actually been working in the tech industry a  long time.  So both of my parents are computer scientists and mathematicians  as well.  So I had the luxury of having a lot of  toys at home, even as a little kid way back  in the nineties.  And that naturally led on to doing electronic engineering and  computer science right here at UW.  A.  Uh, In fact, the year I started was when the  computer science building was first opened.  So it's been around as long as I have.  So through computer science and electronic engineering at the time,  there was the first dot com boom.  We had an engineering boom already, and then that went  sideways.  But the first dot com boom went up, so I  pursued a career more in computer science.  And coincidentally, at that particular time, um, the Internet was  a brand spanking new thing.  So in 94 we had the first dial-up services back  into UW A.  And we could log in and use go for and  all these other new fantastic tools to connect with other  universities around the world.  But it was a new age effectively, so I want  to draw a few parallels.  Basically to what you've learned in IOT and what we  had faced back then because history seems to be repeating  itself.  So the devices we worked with initially in computer science  were low powered computers.  Um, we always had to work in programming around limited  memory limited CPU storage wasn't always the best.  Connectivity was haphazard at best.  And we had all these different, um, networking technologies that  we had to deal with not just CPR P, but  Nobel Net and Banion vines.  And everyone was vying to try and be the standard  that everyone adopts to.  So everything was quite scattered.  There were very few standards, and people kind of made  things up as they went along, so we'd have our  own standards for devices talking to each other as well.  And then, of course, when it comes to software, we  had to make compromises.  Um, because of the limited resources, the sketchy connections overseas  we software wasn't built very reliably.  Um, things could have been out, and we often worked  around that in different ways.  But again, there was no set standards.  So I guess what's changed to today is that you  do have those particular standards, so working with IOT.  I'm not sure what you've actually specifically covered.  But these days, when you're building little micro controllers, which  we played with back then as well, now you have  little modules you can just put in a lower net.  A module or LTE Bluetooth WiFi.  We pretty much standardised on TCP/IP S and networking stack  as well.  When it comes to communicating between devices we've now standardised  on, everyone knows HTTP that was a brand spanking new  thing, Uh, when I was at uni.  But we do so much more over that now, not  just web pages, but, you know, rest API, S and  soap and so forth.  And on top of that, we have these messaging systems.  They just didn't exist back then.  So I don't know if you've covered service buses like  MQ, TT and Rabbit MQ or AM QP, which lets  you build nice systems where they're totally decoupled.  Um, one end doesn't have to be alive for the  other one to talk to it.  So the disconnection remote access through regional areas isn't that  big of an issue.  And of course, the content.  Before we had things like ED I for electronic document  exchange and a few other standards, but again, they were  very proprietary to different vendors.  And that's now switched over to XML and Jason are  the two most predominant ones.  And above all, security.  Um, there wasn't any back when I started uni.  Everything was clear text.  So RS a was around, but, um, other than that,  everything was pretty much made up as you went along.  Clear text.  We just assumed the best in people.  But now, of course, we've got a lot of bad  actors and, uh, people trying to intercept data and read  data because data is king.  So with those technologies, they get pieced together nicely as  well these days.  And this is actually what we work with.  So instead of having everything piece wise, um, the diagram  down the bottom that's actually from Amazon Web services.  But Azora and Microsoft have a similar stack.  You can buy yourself an IOT hub as a service,  and it then provides you all of these tools and  facilities to connect to, um it builds a base layer  on design as well.  So you're not building something from scratch.  And those particular designs, um, the way they're modelled and  structured, will then actually also branch into other areas of  computer science.  So I guess the message here is as you're looking  for work, don't and you're using IOT.  Those skills that you've learned will quite happily reach out  into other areas of computer science.  So a really common strategy for doing services online these  days is micro services.  Um, micro services are small units of work that we  deploy on the Internet.  So rather than having a great big monolithic application, we  have little bits everywhere which are good at their own  particular thing, only just creating an invoice, just triggering a  message on certain events.  Really easy to debug, slightly painful to manage because of  the large scale of them.  But that's what these systems are for.  And it's similar with IOT.  Um, a lot of the time when we do work  with IOT devices.  We're talking about thousands of devices out there all at  the same time, and you don't want to be connecting  to each one man, uh, individually.  So having a nice structure in design that works well,  micro service architecture, you can look for work.  You can look for any kind of projects out there  that involve that, and the skills you've learned in IOT  will definitely translate to that almost on a 1 to  1 basis.  Similarly, um, domain driven design.  You'll find online courses for domain driven design.  Even LinkedIn learning has a few up to, um, course  work on various online platforms that you might have to  pay a bit of money for.  But it's that whole.  There's an event runs in a particular domain, and a  corresponding action happens.  So DDD quite popular these days, and mapping all of  that out again lines up a lot to how IOT  devices work, so definitely worth looking into as well, and  then gives you some sort of parallel career streams around  architecture.  So when we do work with IOT, um, it's very  rare that we actually play with the little devices.  So the hardware aspect, the communication aspect and then managing  the software and the messaging there tends to be totally  different teams of people, especially on scales.  So really common systems these days are like fleet management  systems for vehicles.  So there's a big push at the moment in mining,  especially on tracking emissions, and the easiest way to do  that is to first tap into the existing fleet management  systems, which give you details about each particular vehicle, how  far they've travelled, what their engine capacities are, what they've  cycled through.  And then, mathematically, you can calculate what estimated emissions might  come on there.  And then from there we start working on other IOT  devices, which might be sniffers, so they'll sit on the  exhaust pipe and basically analyse upcoming chemicals.  So continuous emission monitoring systems.  Again, it's a whole different world of hardware engineers that  will work that out.  And then we just integrate with those particular systems and  collect all that data together, even at its simplest, smart  metres.  Um, there's one organisation we've looked at and all their  power metres like you have in your houses.  They're just a fleet of smart metres that you can  just take ratings off on a how many kilowatt hours  have been used over the last hour kind of status.  But these are all sort of different scenarios in IOT  that we currently use.  But then how those skills can easily translate back to  what you might do on a day to day basis  for work.  So I guess the last slide for me.  I don't like too many slides is what you can  do from here yourself.  So when people come to us looking for employment, um,  what we're really keen on is people that have that  mentality to keep learning.  Uh, what?  I studied here at uni.  Uh, the job I've got now didn't exist when I  was studying at uni, But the skills I picked up  definitely translated.  And the job you guys are gonna have, um, in  the next five years probably doesn't exist yet either.  It's continually changing, so it's less about what specific things  you know, down to nuts and bolts and standards and  techniques.  But that ongoing mindset to just keep on learning keep  on learning.  So we will often ask people when they come for  interviews to show us projects you're doing in your own  time.  I don't care how big it is.  It's the fact that you're doing it that matters.  And for this ongoing learning, there's as mentioned before LinkedIn  learning There's a whole bunch of other online training sites  available.  A lot of them are free.  Sometimes it might cost you 2030 bucks to a site.  You, to me, are fairly common as well, and through  that, get familiar with the tools in the industry as  well.  So university sets you up nicely for the core concepts,  and then usually what we need to do is show  you how to use the tools, but also how it  applies to the industry.  So if you're already coming in and we know how  to use visual studio or VS code, or whatever your  coding platform of choice is, we then just have to  apply what you know to industry, and you can jump  straight into a project, and" metadata={}

So if you're already coming in and we know how  to use visual studio or VS code, or whatever your  coding platform of choice is, we then just have to  apply what you know to industry, and you can jump  straight into a project, and that's really valuable for us.  Ongoing qualifications.  Um, there's a couple that you can get from Microsoft.  I think you pay 100 and $60 each, and the  Amazon ones about 100 and 50.  So ballpark the same, but just constantly doing those.  In fact, our team, um, they are on a schedule  to do at least two every year.  So if you're already coming in with that sort of  mindset and that attitude, it makes it a lot easier  to employ people and to satisfy your professional curiosity.  A lot of the vendors like Amazon and as well  they have free services.  You can just sign up, play around to tinker, Um,  try things out.  IOT devices themselves are easy to get a hold of  that you can connect to with various platforms.  Even watchers these days are recording constantly.  So, yes, that is effectively what I came to talk  about.  So questions.  They're shy.  Yes.  Can you give us like some background about your company?  What you doing machine?  Oh, that's a big question.  And Ella should be covering the company mission a fair  bit.  But so in his head, he's just said, I'm testing  you to me just to make sure it is just  like another partner.  No one is just like another Microsoft partner, but we  are a Microsoft partner predominantly, Uh, but we are working  a lot more in AWS as well now.  So we traditionally have worked in social services because both  of the company owners, um, they had a mission to  try and give back to society rather than just working  for the shareholders.  Like every person working in the resource sector is in  western Australia.  It's more about doing, working for not for profits and  trying to do something that tries to make the world  a better place.  So that's our mission based on the professional history that  the team had at the time.  Um, some of us have been working in the Microsoft  space for decades, so it was just the easy one  in, um, but technology is technology, to be honest, you  know, AWS lamb or or functions, same thing, different shrink  wrap.  It's they're comparable.  So yeah, we became a Microsoft partner on that.  And now we're branching out more into not just government  services, but also mining sector, uh, as everyone in W  a does.  But we are trying to work more in the, um,  socially conscious areas of mining such as a SG.  So emissions, social governance.  And that's where some of the IOT things come in  as well.  With regards to emissions, um, using Microsoft Stack, mostly.  But a lot of the big mining companies like to  hedge their bets, so they'll have to have half the  infrastructure on AWS and the other half on, uh, Microsoft.  But nay, I should give you a lot more overview  about the company history on that shortly.  That's it.  Excellent.  Yes.  I'm handing over to you just now to thank ok  OK.  Thanks, Alex.  Wow.  That was a very quick presentation from Alex, right?  I don't think I understood anything apart from the last  slide about professional development.  Who Who understood anything here.  That's the word, huh?  You got something out of it?  Yeah.  So I think you touch on everything from high level,  but he didn't mention exactly whether it's like, Yeah, and  that's a right, right?  Yeah.  So Q and a is there, Uh, can I can  I suggest that, uh, we finish this first lecture in  a in a little bit more?  Learning more that.  Hey, uh, the whole idea for presentation was to start  the conversation, and it can be two ways, right?  If if the lecturer comes in, guest lecturer comes in  and gives you something, throws something at you.  If you don't get it, then it should spark the  question.  That's the university is about right.  You ask the question.  So do you think you took the opportunity to ask  the question to the industry expert who came in to  see you?  Huh?  Do do you wanna go another go?  You want to have Alex back up here again and  maybe try a few questions and be honest and say  what you learned or what you didn't understood.  And what you want to know from the slides or  what he does in his work.  Get to know him or get to know the company  like you asked or get to know the slide.  Contend which people do you think you want to take  that advantage while you still have a chance?  No.  Yes, you have.  OK, Alex.  Coming back again here?  Yeah, they are paying huge money.  So let's take advantage.  Yeah, you guys are paying huge money.  So take some advantage of this man.  Which he is here.  That's what the university life is about.  OK, throw a question, please.  OK.  He said, Yeah.  Feel like there's some subject.  Good.  Makes it difficult.  You, um I guess My answer.  Can you hear me?  OK, without the mic you recording?  Got it.  I'll just hang on to it.  Um, I guess the message there is don't let it  feel like everything is transient.  It's not.  Uh, everything is just built in layers, to be honest,  just like your network stack and everything.  It's layer upon layer upon layer.  We learn something, we improve on what was there previously.  And in fact, knowing that history, um, is something that  gives me a lot of an advantage to people that  are new to the field, especially things like troubleshooting or  diagnosing issues.  Sometimes modern systems do really peculiar things, and it's because  of the way they were implemented 15 years ago, which  I mean, remember.  But somebody just graduating now has no idea, because they  weren't there.  So having that legacy knowledge, there's no such thing as  wasted learning as what it comes down to.  So a lot of what you have learned here and  assuming any other courses as well, since I'm not privy  to what they are, it all just compounds and it  all comes together.  So it's more about the conceptual ideas, understanding specific things,  like this version of this editor.  Yeah, sure, they come and go, you know, flavour of  the month always vanishes.  But even programming languages, you know, C++ is still a  very predominant language these days in what we do or  derivatives thereof, like your C, sharps and javas, they all,  you know, roughly look and smell the same.  Um, So what you learn in those conceptual ideas doesn't  change but some of the learning I put up, for  example, like your Amazon services.  Yeah, they change every six months, So then it becomes  one of those get in.  And that's why we look for that with students or,  um, anybody that comes to us.  What are you doing To keep yourself up to date  and learning the incremental changes over time is a lot  easier than just trying to jump in and learn everything  from scratch.  Because, yeah, you're trying to nail a moving target, Do  you?  Do you think the short answer would be that in  IT you never stop learning?  Yeah, that's why we do it.  If you want to do the same job for 40  years, which sounds really boring and find something else.  But this one, it's constantly challenging new challenges.  There's only one requirement to be in IT industry, and  that's to be continuous learning and growth mindset.  So" metadata={}

There's only one requirement to be in IT industry, and  that's to be continuous learning and growth mindset.  So industry changing too quick, right?  If you if you want to not learn too much,  then go into taxation because once you learn, then you  can keep applying the rest of your life.  Yeah, or you go into accounting.  Once you learn to be a CPA.  Then you can keep using the licence CPA for the  rest of your life.  Few small changes might happen in their accounting or taxation.  But law, for example, law, of course it changes, but  majority of the time, you'll keep applying the same law.  Basic principle of English law.  Right?  But it industry is not like that.  You'll have to keep learning.  And the moment you stop learning, you are obsolete.  And that's the only trade personal trade you require to  be successful in this industry, continuous learning and growth mindset.  The moment you think you graduated and you, you you  are ready for the industry.  You're already a failure just because you graduate, it isn't  me.  You're ready for the industry now.  The real learning starts.  Yeah, So a continuous learning.  Is that the short answer?  Other questions.  There you go about the learning part and about the  how important is the certification, for instance, such as a  the developer, associate or like architect, for instance, to get  into um so they're not mandatory.  But if you've actually taken the time to learn something  yourself, it puts you into the top one or 2%  of people applying for a job.  It's just the fact that you've made that effort.  Uh, for some organisations such as us, because we're a  Microsoft partner, we have certain obligations.  We have a direct need for those particular certifications because  we're constantly having to prove back to the vendor that  we have people on board.  Amazon is the same.  If we want leads and opportunities coming from them and  them to assist us, we must at least have a  minimum baseline of qualified professionals working for us before they  will actually help.  Um, so for us, it's critical.  But if you're working for other industries mining organisations, it'll  come up a lot because we're in western Australia.  It's probably not as critical, but at least it demonstrates  to the person that is interviewing you at a technical  level that you have played with those things before rather  than just your say so and which is pretty much  what everyone else will be doing.  So especially when it comes from graduates, Um will often  apply for advertising possession.  I might get 30 40 applicants to maybe have actually  done some sort of certification or tinkered with something in  their spare time, and they will almost always be called  in for an interview.  Everyone else kind of looks the same, and it just  becomes especially fresh from uni.  Would you say that, uh, if you had a person  who's a graduate from UNI and somebody who has industry  certification, would you give a job to the one who's  just uni graduate or has a certification only, Or that  would come down to a tech assessment?  But their technical qualification does carry a lot of weight.  It is not as simple as you must have a  bachelor degree.  Yeah, So if you have a technical qualification like a  zoo architect or AWS developer associate certificates that will get  you from in terms of yeah, exactly right.  In fact, going back to your accounting, um, thing before  we often do get people that have an accounting background  so their degrees might be in accountancy, but they want  to switch into technology.  So if they've done something around ER P systems manufacturing  and warehousing that kind of thing, they're quite useful to  us as well, because they actually carry some industry experience  on the customers.  We're talking to, um, similarly with geologists when it comes  to mining if you're trying to work with emissions and  that kind of thing.  So sometimes people in those other sciences have additional info.  But then the industry qualifications show me that they're dedicated  to the technology side as well.  Of the dancers.  Yeah, but maybe like a short one.  You're saying that the developer so bank, um, the solution.  Architecture ones are usually in Microsoft.  They're a level above.  So it's they usually go by really simple star system  or one star two star three star.  So the first ones are your developer associates, and then  your architecture one set or a three star.  So usually that's part of the path.  So what I showed online was just the next progression.  Yeah, go ahead.  Um, they won't commit to a single technology for a  system.  So if they're doing a vehicle management system, they'll park  half of it on Amazon and half of it on  azure and have them synchronised with each other, or they  might have foul over.  So if one particular technology gets superseded, or, you know,  Microsoft decide to change something that makes it no longer  viable to host that particular service, they have a backup  system.  So That's more about redundancy than anything else.  Yeah, there was another question here.  Yeah, because, uh, internship for students or yes, Usually we're  final year students.  Um, but we do quite a few internships.  Sometimes that might be part of, uh What is it  that a CS D?  The professional year?  Um, depending on what you need is as an initial  cover pretty much everyone in our organisation was born overseas.  I think there's one person that was born in Australia,  so yeah, internships often come up especially OK.  One more last question.  OK, I, I would ask because most of our students  are masters in IT.  They are, as Alex said, some of them are switching  their field.  They come from accounting and other background.  And, uh, we have quite a number of, uh, the  one students.  So my question is, when someone comes for an interview  or apply what are different skills you are?  One is the technical skills.  One is.  You said, uh, the initiative or the learning?  Yeah.  Well, I'll, I'll cover my presentation, and then you'll have  some of the answers there.  That what kind of company we are and what we  look for.  And what we do right and where where the value  alignments are aligned.  So I think my presentation will answer some of your  questions in there.  Um, the short answer is you need to have a  growth mindset.  Yeah, if you come from uni, that's when the real  learning will start.  So if you're ready to learn, that's when you are  welcome.  Learning never stops in the in the work environment.  Yeah, if you come that Hey, I have done this  this project in uni uh, I done this unit and  I have high distinctions.  That's not going to help you.  What's going to help you is to say, I'm willing  to learn now and willing to learn from colleagues willing  to learn from the client.  And I'm going to have a growth mindset.  And that's the first trait you'll be required to have.  And that not just saying, but showcasing that.  What do you mean by growth?  Learning?  I said, Hey, I had done this certification on my  own.  I went online and I did this" metadata={}

And, uh, we have quite a number of, uh, the  one students.  So my question is, when someone comes for an interview  or apply what are different skills you are?  One is the technical skills.  One is.  You said, uh, the initiative or the learning?  Yeah.  Well, I'll, I'll cover my presentation, and then you'll have  some of the answers there.  That what kind of company we are and what we  look for.  And what we do right and where where the value  alignments are aligned.  So I think my presentation will answer some of your  questions in there.  Um, the short answer is you need to have a  growth mindset.  Yeah, if you come from uni, that's when the real  learning will start.  So if you're ready to learn, that's when you are  welcome.  Learning never stops in the in the work environment.  Yeah, if you come that Hey, I have done this  this project in uni uh, I done this unit and  I have high distinctions.  That's not going to help you.  What's going to help you is to say, I'm willing  to learn now and willing to learn from colleagues willing  to learn from the client.  And I'm going to have a growth mindset.  And that's the first trait you'll be required to have.  And that not just saying, but showcasing that.  What do you mean by growth?  Learning?  I said, Hey, I had done this certification on my  own.  I went online and I did this free courses on  my own.  Nobody asked me to do that.  That's how you show by action.  Not by saying yes.  Yes, I'm open to learning.  Show us what you've been doing.  It.  Yeah, on your own.  Without the assignment without lecturer telling you anything?  Yeah.  If you can prove that that means you are a  good candidate to start with.  Does answer a short question now.  OK, well, I'm glad that you took advantage of your  questions and answers here.  Whenever there's a guest lecturer coming in, it's an important  moment for you to ask questions and get noticed.  That's another way to get an interview.  Possibly that.  Hey, I remember you asking me that question.  So you wanna stand out, take this opportunity.  So thanks, Alex.  Again for, uh, giving your time and and coming in  there.  Can we give him a round of applause?  Yeah.  All right.  So let's start with, uh, slightly different topics now.  Uh, my presentation is not about IOT Internet, uh, technology  or anything.  It's this I'm sharing the journey of mine.  Why?  Because I was where you are.  10 years ago came as an international student looking for  PR to migrate.  Honesty.  I was interested in masters, but that was the easiest  for us to migrate to Australia right before I did.  Even my master's I was already working in the industry  and and had a lot of experience working in there  in in the tech sector.  But Australia, if you give money in university, you get  PR.  So I thought that's a good pathway.  How many of you are here for the PR?  Tell me the truth.  The rest of them are going back or what?  What are they doing?  They already have it.  Yeah, So more than half are here for PR, Right?  OK, don't worry.  Australia will give you that because you are in the  right course.  Yeah.  You already get the qualification, which is recognised by a  skill occupation list.  Your agent must have told you to do this course.  Some of them you decided yourself or some of you  would know who can do this course.  Right.  So this is already a good course for you.  And you're going to get your PR and a job.  Don't worry.  The it industry is is is looking for good people  in there.  And that is how I was 10 years ago.  But there's something else I did.  And that's what I'm going to share with you.  Is that OK?  Yeah.  Now A lot of people Ask me, what's your success  story?  How How Come where you are right now, running a  business, hiring a lot of people.  And you have achieved what you have achieved And my  answer goes back to the simple term is the success  journey is yoi versus resume.  Who knows the word E here.  Is one person there?  Yeah.  You wanna tell us?  What do you mean by No, but do you know  what it means?  That's right.  Yeah.  So is what people will read about you when you  are in the coffin.  Yeah, and the people have gathered like this and they  are going to talk about you and they're going to  remember you.  And they're going to read the things you have done  for the society or for them or what?  You mean for them.  They're not going to read your resume.  Have you ever been to the funeral?  And where somebody read a resume and saying that Hey,  you were a CEO raise this much money from Silicon  Valley, drove this car or had this many businesses, this  many property portfolio.  Will that be what red do you think at the  end?  Hm?  But we work towards our resume all over life, don't  we?  How can I find a job?  Where can I go?  How can I get a promotion?  What's the next property portfolio I can build because we  work towards resume all over life, don't we?  Yeah.  So simple question to start with is, should we be  working on our or should we working on our resume?  Now I'm going to show you that how I've been  working on both, not just one and how it kinda  correlates.  So on the left side, you'll see my EG on  the right side.  You will see my resume.  And that's how the presentation is divided between personal and  professional.  Yeah, you'll see what I've been personally doing it.  And then what?  I've been doing it professionally And how both of them  are helping me to where I am today.  Is that clear?  The format of the presentation?  Yeah, right.  So I came as a student 2012 international student joined  Curtin University and at the same time, I started a  business called Technology.  My business card was already printed before I came here  and I had applied for an a BN online, which  is Australian business number, and you can apply it for  free and it takes 24 hours, so that means you  can generate an invoice.  The phone number was like a at the time cheapest  Sim card.  You could find $5 and I printed the business card  and ready.  The reason being, I knew that it's not going to  be easy to find a job as a student as  soon as you arrive.  And Australia will use you as a cheap labour to  get you to do uber eats or or restaurant jobs  or anything cleaning jobs.  Right, because they want you as a student as a  cheap labour.  So I knew that it's going to be not easy  for me to find a job.  So the business started from day one before it even  arrived, and that was called Tantra Technology.  What is TANTRA did website designing software development application, graphic  design, social media, domain name registration, basic stuff.  Anybody can do that these days, right?  You can go to Squarespace and build a website for  anybody.  That's what I started doing then I joined Curti University,  think I CD Student Association as a committee member, and  that was in a second week and became a member  of Australian Computer Society.  How many of you are here?  A CS member 2345 Only 56 people.  A CS member, right.  They have a student membership.  I don't know how much it is right now.  60 $80 a year.  Yeah, I became a member.  And guess what?  I used to feed myself at all their events for  free.  As a student, you want to save money, right?  You go to AC AC when you learn something like  this.  But at the same time, you feed yourself.  They always have some amazing catering.  And I used to attend at least 15 20 events  a year and have my dinner there.  But at the same time, I used to network and  learn.  So being an a CS member can save you money,  get your network and also can help you learn something  new there.  Right?  So it's necessary as an IC T professional that you  are a member of a CS.  Now accounting professionals will be member of CPA, right?  The HR courses will be a member of a HR  i Australian home resource.  Something every industry had some sort of association which you  should be part of, and a CS was that which  is for us as an IT student.  And I became part of that while I was at  university, I was complaining to the lecturers and everybody anybody  I meet who are the staff that international students are  not given opportunity to work in the campus.  It's only the local students are working there and library,  computer labs, cafe or offices.  I see a lot of local students who are studying  part" metadata={}

It's only the local students are working there and library,  computer labs, cafe or offices.  I see a lot of local students who are studying  part time and working part time.  But then international students are not given jobs.  So I started complaining and I make a lot of  noise.  I went to the dean of international head of the  school, the career centre director everywhere and to shut me  off, they said, This boy is making of noise.  Let's give him a job in the career centre and  they made me a staff there and I got a  part time job within the university.  So within three months I was working with the university.  I said, Hey, I don't know anybody here.  I'm new to this country and I need a job  and you helped me.  You said that you will help me settle down and  you have a career centre Now.  It's been three months.  Help me And they got me a job there to  shut me up.  Yeah, so I had a star ID within the first  three months.  And there's a saying in Australia, the squeaky wills makes,  uh, gets the success or or gets notice.  Squeaky will means the one who makes the noise.  Yeah, in life to get ahead.  Sometimes you have to make a lot of noise.  You had to always be a squeaky wheel.  Yeah, and if you do that, you'll get notice.  So that's the first thing to learn why I was  invited to be part of the think I citizen or  an association member because the chairperson saw that within a  one month he knew everybody in the campus.  He knew the student guild people.  He knew the library people.  He knew the, uh, dean of international head of the  school career Centre people because I was just networking in  the campus every day because that was the place.  I didn't have a car.  I didn't know anything outside the campus and I could  just walk around, go to different people's office and meet  everybody.  And that was my village, Right?  To get to know everybody.  And the chairperson of the association thought this boy is  good at networking and business development.  I think he would be a good committee member.  And within the first month, I was part of sitting  there.  Then I became a part of the international students, uh,  committee as well.  And then I became part of the Board of Advisory  and E, do you know what is a Is the  programme run by every university for projects around the world  and it's a competition and became part of that.  But within the first six months, I managed to find  a job with the airport Uh uh with the Garuda  Indonesia airline.  And then I became part of the, uh which is  the biggest largest.  Uh uh, Tafe system Private tafe system here.  Navi.  When you do a professional year programme, you could do  it from Navi as well.  And I became I CD project manager there, including I  became a business analyst at on board group, so I  had a few projects going on.  Remember, I had an A BN so which means I  could contract I don't have to be employed and I  can do jobs for other different businesses and I can  generate invoice and I can charge them right and I  can declare that I've been working 20 hours a week  online.  Who knows?  So I was doing many projects having many jobs and  making money within the first six months.  But it wasn't easy.  What happened is when I was a think IC T  student association.  I generated an event called Sundowner for IC T student.  I invited people from Navi from Da Na Group from  EY from KPMG around 16 different organisations, including Microsoft.  I invited their HR managers and leaders to come and  attend the Sundowner event where the students can meet like  you to the prospective employers.  And I put the whole thing together and I raised  the sponsorship for that.  And also I did the marketing for that.  And I did the venue preparation and logistics around that.  And by doing that, connecting the students and the industry  people who got connected to all of them.  Yeah, and when I needed a job so helping others  help yourself, right?  Yeah.  Creating opportunity for others.  You create opportunity for yourself.  Yeah, that's all happened through the student, uh, be becoming  part of the committee and everything, and then you create  a lot of events and everything.  Then I became part of the I moved the university  in 2013.  Uh, went to ECU.  What I learned is that in Curry University, there are  four units you have to do for the same course  in history.  You had to do three units, and the outcome is  still the same masters of management information system.  So I thought, hm, three units less money outcome is  still the same.  But they also had a campus in Mount Lowly, which  was near the city.  So I thought that's good for me because then I  have a client in the city.  I can be active, and I can be close to  the where the actions are CBD and everything, and I  moved there.  Then I joined the E-GROUP Association as a committee member.  Then I got invited to sit on the organising committee  for I, uh uh inside award A, which is the  W IC Industry award like Oscar for tech industry and  a lot of student uh, projects gets finalised in into  I, uh, a award.  And then they win.  Right?  And UW has won a couple of times as well.  So I was a judge, and I was also a  committee member.  And then I got invited to sit on the innovation  committee for city of, uh, for $20,000 funding for the  startups and the mayor.  And the CEO invited me there.  Now you can start to see that within the few.  Within less than a year.  I had managed to network enough to get recognised as  an I CD professional out there and having enough projects  and works and everything.  And I'm giving away my time on the left hand  side.  You are seeing a lot of my volunteering position.  I'm getting involved.  Do I get paid for that?  No.  But it's only helping me to get a job in  the projects on the right side, which is my resume.  How am I getting network?  How am I getting meeting people?  And how am I getting opportunity?  Is that is that becoming slightly clear now?  Yeah.  I launched a post A project which is a project  to help students like you.  I was finding a lot of other students who are  struggling.  And I thought, Let's do something which can help other  students not only help myself and I found a job  and businesses running and everything.  The post a project was about taking a photo right  now is a postcard app where you can send a  postcard like good old days back home to your family  members.  So right now, if you want to buy a postcard,  we have to go to the shop, get a postcard,  write something on there, go to post office, buy a  stamp and put it into the post bin and send  it on the other side, right?  We don't do that anymore.  We just send a WhatsApp messages.  But what if you wanted to send a postcard like  other days?  So I launched an app where we can take a  photo right to and from pay $3 for local or  $5 for international, and it goes as a postcard on  the other end.  But the entire project was social impact, which means we  are donating this app to good.  Sammy, do you know good Sammy is the way you  can buy second hand clothes and everything?  Yeah, like salvos Yeah, so they employ" metadata={}

Yeah, like salvos Yeah, so they employ people with disabilities  to help them get a job.  And I donated the entire app to good Sams for  free by building with students.  And this project was launched by the mayor of the  city, Lisa Scafidi, at the time of City of Perth.  And the governor, Malcolm Maus, who was a governor at  that stage, gave a certificate of appreciation to me and  all the students, and it became a huge story into  the start of world.  In 2012.  13.  Startup was still new in Perth and everything, and this  project made a lot of noise and news and everything.  And now everybody in the industry knows that does have  development.  That brought me a lot of work.  But 11 students, which I hired throughout this project as  a volunteer to work on that 10 of them got  the job because of this projects out there.  One person went back to Indonesia, but sorry, one of  them works for me.  One of them works for me.  Uh, but the other nine found jobs somewhere else, right?  And one went back to Indonesia and everything.  So, by becoming part of this project and volunteering everybody  benefited.  But I also personally got a good publicity out there  that he delivered some social impact drive project.  Now I did it not for just one reason, but  for various reasons.  Right?  And the technology was now becoming successful and I didn't  have to work anymore.  And I can start employing people.  Remember, I'm still one year graduate only I haven't finished  my master's yet, right?  I'm still studying full time and while running business and  everything.  Eventually, 2014, I graduated and I was selected as a  mass bearer, which is the honour they give you Student  of the year.  And when the congregation is running towards the stage, I'm  the front man leading the entire congregation.  Vice chancellors behind me and I'm sitting on the stage  and getting graduated.  And that was the honour was given to me on  on here.  You see my auntie?  She's the one who put me through the school.  I failed 10 standard four times.  Who's here from India?  Yeah, you know, to SE school exam, right?  Secondary school exam.  I failed that four times and my auntie didn't give  up on me.  She kept pushing me to go back go back to  studies and everything.  And eventually I became a lecturer at the ECU.  So she deserves to be there when I graduate.  Yes or no?  Yeah.  So she came and she was very proud, very proud  that finally, uh, I I passed and did my graduation  and everything, and it was a very proud moment for  her.  But at the same time, I was proud that I  could fly her over here with my own money.  Yeah, because I was already making money.  Then I became a guest lecturer at, uh, West Coast  Institute.  And then Edith Cowan university invited me to sit on  the advisory committee for school of Information System and the,  uh, uh, the masters of management, information system supply chain  and computer science.  Few courses and I have to sit there and review  all the units and give advice with other few industry  experts and everything.  And I've been running that position for five years.  Almost now.  I'm the longest running member of that advisory committee.  The CU 2014.  The business failed.  I had a business partner here locally who, uh, had  Australian citizenship.  And and remember, I wanted to get my PR done,  and I needed an employer who can nominate me and  everything.  So technology needed a director, and I brought somebody local  here who can be part of that, and we did  a good business together.  But then the person took the money away from the  business, didn't deliver the projects and resigned and left me  into debt and everything and not a good experience as  a business partner.  So it created a lot of trouble and I lost  the business and I became almost homeless.  I didn't have money to pay the rent.  I don't have a sponsorships.  I only have a graduate certificates and I have debt  over to pay off the staff and the client and  everything.  Now it can't go detail too much, but it wasn't  a good experience to be in a partnership right, and  the paper work wasn't done correctly, and a lot of  things I had to learn to how the Australian system  works to do our partnerships and how the share works  and how the ordinary share works and a class share  works.  You have to learn all these things when you go  into the business and partnerships and everything, it was a  failed project.  At the same time, I went into looking for a  job and MBE printing is a printing company which they  do print services.  So I joined there as a business elephant person and  became a employee there to pay the rent and keep  going on the left side.  Borderless Gandhi organisation was launched and this was launched to  promote the message of peace, equality and non violence and  promote the message of harmony within the community here.  And I did an exhibition at the Bell Tower and  this entire project was to keep myself occupied and focus  on doing community work at the same time.  Um, 2015 I met Vincent through Australian society event and  he is my current business partner.  Uh, and him and I both got along really well  and we decided to go go on a journey together  and and join, And he was CRM experts in Microsoft.  So he was doing a lot of work where, uh,  Microsoft CR MS are used in not for profit sectors.  And we thought, let's let's put our expertise together and  build something more purposeful and meaningful.  And then that's when I started my second partnership again.  Now, a lot of people ask me that question unless  you just had a failed partnerships.  And now you're going into another one very soon.  I said, Well, you can't stop trusting people just because  you had one bad experience, right?  Every bad experience doesn't mean that Hey, you cannot.  You cannot go into partnership again.  You learn something from that and and you're not going  to do the same thing again into the new one.  So we did the right paperwork.  We made sure that everything is done correctly.  Your shares are allocated correctly.  You have the right authority in place.  And now you are doing it everything in a correct  way.  What you learned from your previous failed partnerships and everything.  So just because you had one bad experience doesn't mean  that you cannot start again.  Remember that, right?  You can learn something from that and give it a  go again and everything.  Then I became the part of the OE Award which  is run by Curry University as a as a judge.  Then I became a judge for innovator of the Year  programme which is run by the state government and also  became a technology adviser for Innovation Centre, which is a  government innovation centre in Bentley.  Uh, at the same time, ium, uh, was now running  and I was doing business development for that.  On on 2015, I launched westtech assemblage.  This was the first time.  Now, do you remember that when I came to the  country, I became part of the citizen association, did an  event called" metadata={}

Then I became a judge for innovator of the Year  programme which is run by the state government and also  became a technology adviser for Innovation Centre, which is a  government innovation centre in Bentley.  Uh, at the same time, ium, uh, was now running  and I was doing business development for that.  On on 2015, I launched westtech assemblage.  This was the first time.  Now, do you remember that when I came to the  country, I became part of the citizen association, did an  event called Sundown right.  And through that I met a lot of companies and  HR people and recruiters and everything.  Now I thought that now I'm part of the Microsoft  technology and illuminus and everything.  What do I do to get in front of the  whole industry?  And westtech assemblage was the event which I brought together  for the first time in Western Australia, where meeting of  tech mine are coming together and it was held at  Government House boardroom 440 people.  So I brought all those association who I was part  of them together on a name of collaboration e-group association  chair, Australian Society chair, O Award chair, the chief scientist  of Western Australia.  Uh, everybody who I knew.  I said, let's come together and we unite and we  build one joint event together, and this was never done  before.  So West Australian newspaper put up an article meeting of  tech, M and WF first, and that was the first  time the Government House boardroom was used as an event  space, which was quite prestigious at the time and event  was highly attended.  And guess what?  440 people in the audience, most of them in the  tech sector now I was connected to that.  But also, everybody else got connected.  And a lot of different associations who came together started  working together.  And this event still runs.  After seven years.  Westtech assembly is still going, and every year we have  this assemblage happening.  And next one is of 16th February.  Uh uh, for the digital inclusion.  We'll talk about that more later.  Uh, then I became a chair of collaboration equals innovation,  and I awards Judge I award is a national award.  And then university invited me to be a lecturer at,  uh, uh, Edith University.  Now all these things which are happening on the left  side are all not making money.  That's not resume.  Yeah, I'm giving my time.  I'm volunteering at the right time.  I'm building a business, finding jobs.  I'm losing the business.  I'm again finding a business.  And again, I'm starting my life again on a professional  life.  So resume is going up and down.  But personal life, nothing is changing, which is who you  are.  As a volunteer, you're always giving time.  Yeah, you're always out there doing something, whether you are  employed or not employed.  Then I became a president for vice president for WH  chapter for Australia India Business Council and CR member.  And then Vincent and I decided that now we're in  a focus on business as a primary area because I  was involved in too many different things.  I had 14 different hats and I was always busy  doing so many things outside, and it was necessary to  focus on the business.  So I thought, Let's continue using business as a vehicle  to do good in the society and do what I  do is to give back and not just giving back  as a time to sit on the committees and different  places to volunteer, but continue doing the good work using  business as a vehicle.  This launch University of Western Australia has a Uni Hall  residential facility and we launch digital literacy training for indigenous  students who come on scholarship from regional areas.  And this is to teach office 65 share point, modal  blackboard and everything and and teach them enough so that  they can compete with local and international students and everything.  And this programme is running since then, Uh uh with  U Uni Hall.  And in 2019, we were given the, uh, partner of  the year a Global award by Microsoft.  Now Microsoft launched Tech for Social Impact team.  And because we are focused on the, uh, uh, tech  for social impact around the world, they look for the  partners who are doing something meaningful work, purposeful work.  And we were selected as a global partner.  And for the first time, Microsoft gave such an award  in Las Vegas in in front of 47,000 people in  RC Arena, Sort of arena was there and then this  was a big deal.  It was a big news.  It was all over the news that some small company  from Perth has been selected as a global partner for  the year for social impact.  And this was because of our work in NDIS National  disability insurance scheme in people's disabilities in Australia, they have  NDIS scheme, and we designed AC RM platform scheduling platform,  which became quite a successful.  And based on that project, we got this, uh uh,  Global award and I had an opportunity to meet the  How many of you recognise this?  Two people here.  Few people.  Yeah.  So?  So the the the gentleman Sala is a CEO of  Microsoft from India and also the AA banga.  He was a MasterCard, uh, chair, uh, CEO.  But now he's a World Bank chairman, and and both  of them are one of the leaders, which I follow,  and and they are quite, uh, uh, amazing in terms  of doing meaningful work in the society out there, making  a difference, not only running a business, and I take  a lot of inspiration from them, and I had opportunity  to meet with them.  Then over the years, a lot of recognition happened.  We, our company, got awarded, uh, from government, from Muslim  Computer Society to business news to Belmont Award to United  Nations Awards.  A lot of recognition happened over the years, and and  it is still continuing.  Uh, recently, we won the social impact award by W  Asian Business Awards and everything, uh, West assemblies is still  going and we launch a digital literacy training in collaboration  with Notre Dame University for people in regional areas.  So we go to Broome and Pras and other regional  areas, and we train indigenous community on how to use  office.  65.  Uh, some of the training programmes are done in partnership.  Some are done directly, uh, and and Alex here is  our volunteer, which comes every every time we have a  training.  And now we are starting the training programme.  Uh, in Banksia Hill, Banksia Hill.  Do you know what it is?  It's a detention centre.  It's a prison for kids and 90% of them are  indigenous kids out there.  So we are starting the training next.  No, tomorrow.  Tomorrow we are starting the training in Banksia Hill, the  detention centre for indigenous kids teaching them how to be  digitally included.  Imagine you come out 10 years in a prison and  then you come out and you don't know how to  use anything.  Internet?  Yeah.  Where?  Where will you be if you just come out of  something where you never heard of anything to do with  office for Internet or browser and you are suddenly brought  into this world where everything is digital, right?  So we are starting a training there.  We also started drone training for people with disabilities own  wheelchair and certified them as a drone pilot and as  as a as a person on wheelchair.  You can work in mining or security or delivery system  or photography, and you can be a drone certified pilot.  Now all these initiatives are happening through illuminate as a  give back.

Uh OPI is Australia Day Council, which is the, uh,  Australian of the year.  They run a award programme called Australian of the Year  and West Australian of the Year, and I was awarded  as an ambassador for the programme and given that honour  and I'm an ambassador.  So every year I go around the different councils in  January to give talks as an ambassador to promote diversity  and inclusion.  Uh, Office of Multicultural Interest, which is the State Government  Department, gave us the Diversity Award.  We have 26 different nationalities in the team of 36.  We have people with disabilities, indigenous background people.  We have a refugee.  We have international students.  We have working Mom, we have age group from 19  to 72 and we have LGBT Q plus community as  well represented.  So it's a very multicultural and diverse organisation.  They all have one thing common, which is they are  all human, red blood and they all have growth mindset.  Right?  But they come from a It doesn't matter which country  which place and everything.  So it's a very highly multicultural organisations which is illuminate  into 2022.  The Mark McGowan which was the premier at the time,  launched my book which was called Terminal four, and entrepreneurs  journey from bicycle to business class and that was a  big success.  Uh, we had a launch of the book inside the  Parliament House.  We had a launch at the AM W A, which  is a Australians of management and and Vice Chancellor of  your university.  Amit.  He did the launch of my book in UW a  Here he he hosted the book launch here.  Uh, there were nine different book launches happened in 2022.  Uh, and this book is become a best seller out  there, and it is written for students and migrant, uh,  and entrepreneurs who wants to learn how to go about  building a business and life in the new country.  And if you get a chance to read, I would  recommend this book, which is written for you guys.  Every chapter has a takeaways in there, uh, and and  and it will help you in your life right now  while you are a student and and after you graduate,  how to go about in industry.  Every chapter has some takeaways in there, and it's called  Terminal Four.  Or you can type N Makan a book and you'll  find that in 2022 we launch digital inclusion.  Western Australia's blueprint in our office.  Seven years of Running West assemblage focusing on digital inclusion,  not leaving anybody behind.  It was a very big theme, and finally, government recognised  that we have to do something as a state, and  we cannot just leave people with disability, indigenous background, people,  senior citizens or community behind.  And that launch of the document was a blueprint was  a very important moment, and that was launched at our  office in December last year and now we are running  a conference with government in February, on the same topic  2022 I was appointed as the World Cup IC CT  20 T 20 World Cup was happening in in Australia  and International Cricket Council appointed me as a T 20  World Cup champion.  Although I don't play cricket but because of my community  involvement, I was given an opportunity to be part of  that and and South Africa, India.  When they were playing, I was the mass bearer trophy  holder and and leading the trophy into the stadium with  the Emirates crew on by by and that was a  big honour.  But I don't play cricket, so don't hate me for  that.  But I was given an opportunity to meet the Indian  team and an Australian team and leading the parade and  and promoting the multiculturalism in the cricket Now Perth IUm  solution is expanding into, uh, mining sector government sector, not  just not for profit sector.  And as Alex mentioned before, we have a a diversification  of the business happening and we have office in Adelaide,  uh, also staff in Brisbane, and 60% of our clients  are national not in W A.  So we have a lot of clients outside W A  and and the business has become quite successful and big.  And it is diversifying slowly, slowly into mining and government  sector, uh, banks that he had already mentioned.  There's another thing we do, which is the national indigenous  business.  Summer school.  Once a year, five universities comes together to help indigenous  students to learn about business for a summer school.  And it's a five days programme.  And and we became part of that and and sponsored  that and also did guest lecture there.  Uh, I wanna leave you with this last deck.  What?  What you saw over the past 2025 minutes, which I  was talking about, is going back to the personal and  professional journey in Yoi versus resume on the left side.  Regardless of what happened in my life, whether I was  student, not student PR, no PR business.  No business employment, no unemployment.  Did I stop at any moment doing what I was  doing on the left?  Am I stopping now?  Uh, you're continuously going doing what you could for the  society and you're giving back.  But on the right side did I ever have any  problem?  Yes, I had a problem.  Did I bounce back?  Yes.  Why?  Because there was a social wealth there.  Now, who knows the difference between social wealth and capital  wealth?  Here.  What is social wealth?  That's your wealth.  Who You're sitting next to each other?  Yeah.  Your friends, Your network.  Your committee?  Yeah.  If you If you maintain that you become friends, it  will help you.  When you get down, they'll try to bring you back  up again.  Yeah.  Your social wealth is important.  Your network is important.  Your colleagues are important.  Your classmates are important.  You need to build your social wealth.  And when you are doing something for the country which  you're going to have APR from and you want PR  in this country, ask yourself a question.  What am I doing for this country first before the  country gives you PR, Are you doing something for this  country?  Are you contributing anywhere you can?  Are you giving back some some time of yours?  Are you volunteering?  Are you helping somebody?  It could be anything, right?  What are you doing?  And what will you get in return?  Of course you'll get everything.  What?  You deserve.  Yeah, you'll get everything what you want.  But what are you doing for the country here?  Which is really give you a safe place to study  live and enjoy the great weather.  Yeah.  So ask yourself a question.  What am I going to do to build my EG?  Walmart resume is getting built up.  And what will you be remembered for?  Yo, right.  Not your resume.  They won't read how much money you raise or what  jobs you had.  They remember how you live your life.  And if you lived a good life, people will hire  you.  People will partner with you.  People will promote you.  People will do business with you because your matters not  just the resume.  Does that give you enough of, uh, what I was  trying to present and and and build a good case  for you to understand through my life" metadata={}

Does that give you enough of, uh, what I was  trying to present and and and build a good case  for you to understand through my life experience?  Yeah.  Awesome.  Thank you, guys.  And I'm ready for questions.  Right.  So we'll start this way and then go up, please.  You're very fast paced in terms of sort of opportunity.  While you were a student in the incidence of overwhelming  pressure already present around you.  How did you manage to to keep yourself in this.  Hm?  What?  Life is always the same.  Not just when you are a student, you are a  student.  Rest of your life.  That's one thing you have to understand.  You are never stop learning.  Just because you're a university, you are a student.  No, no, no.  You are a student the rest of your life, right?  And assignment is going to keep coming at you.  Pressure is going to keep coming at you from personal  professional life.  Uh, deadlines will keep coming at you at work.  Also, what you're experiencing now is nothing going to change.  It's only going to get more.  Yeah.  And if you have kids, that's even more.  Yeah.  So nothing is going to stop.  You're only going to increase from there.  Motivation was I wanted to showcase to my auntie and  my family that hey, all that support they did.  All that help they did on me is not going  to get wasted.  Because my auntie believed in me that you can study.  And because of her faith in me, I managed to  get through the school system and university and became a  lecturer and everything.  And my father didn't give up on me, and he  kept supporting me financially to go and study and pay  the fees and everything.  So I wanted to make my family proud that hey,  your support and your faith is not going to go  wasted.  And that kept motivating me.  And when the book launch happened, I did make a  speech that there is a premiere on the stage and  there's a father on stage at the same time.  And I said all these awards, which I received national  internationals and and Global Awards and everything.  None of that matter really as much as what?  When my father was on stage with the premier launching  the book and and he cried and I cried, and  that was a big moment for me, right?  So the idea is that what motivates you, and for  me, it's family making them proud.  And they're happy that I achieved something and now they  are proud that I'm helping others out there, and that  motivation is is good enough for me.  But at the same time, in a business in illuminate,  creating employment is more important for me, not just winning  awards, giving jobs to the deserving people.  Yeah, who really deserve it.  Who really needs a break.  And those people who are motivated to grab that opportunity  and do the right thing by their opportunity, not just  sit there and think entitlement.  So we, as illuminates, are proud of creating a lot  of approaching a lot of employment.  And and mostly as Alex mentioned before, these people are  not born in this country.  They are migrant.  And we have a lot of international students also working  there, and we have created a lot of opportunity for  them.  And that's the big motivation for me to create an  opportunity for others.  I hope that answers your questions.  Yeah.  Um, how did you find your first for your first  business?  Yeah, that's a good question.  Uh, it was three weeks in, and I was living  in Carrara, which is, uh, uh, student accommodation near the  Curry University campus in in Watford.  And I was waiting at the cross signal at the  red lights, and there were two other students who were  standing there as well, and I just said hello to  them and they were already studying here for a while.  Two semesters.  So I started introducing myself, started talking to them and  the campus is long.  So we were walking towards the classroom and everything, and  I they said, What do you do?  So I just took out my business card and started  giving them, and I said, I'm a student but I  also do website designing, he said.  Oh, we had one website idea.  It's like what he says.  We wanted to sell books, secondhand books because every time  this semester finishes the secondhand books, you have to take  it back to the shop and they they don't give  you good money.  But if you wanted to sell it to other students,  you usually put up on a notice board in your  building, in your in your course, coordinated office or somewhere.  And then you can buy books or you go to  Gumtree and you sell it there or something.  But what if there was a student portal website where  the students can exchange the books second hand books and  they can buy it for half price or they get  more money and everything right?  I said, Ah, that sounds good.  I can do that project for you.  WordPress has a lot of templates, and it's just a  book exchange It's an easy project.  But who has the money?  They said, Oh, we don't have money.  I said, Why don't you find the funding?  So then they found a PhD student who was in  willing to invest into this project.  And PhD students are a little bit rich because they  get paid to study right and they also work.  So he gave $1500 to build this website and I  said, I'll do the website in 1500 because I was  using offshore team, which will cost me $200 to get  it delivered, done, and then $1300 will be my one  month rent, which I said, Bingo.  I got my first project.  My first month rent is covered.  And that's how I found my first project at the  signal in the campus.  Yeah, but then I went to mount lowly, uh, in  a nightclub.  As a student, you're dancing.  You want to go on a date and you want  to meet people.  So I was partying every night, every weekend and everything,  and there was this Aussie guy who was dancing there  as well, and he had a bold head.  So I started playing with him and everything and made  fun of him.  He became friends and he asked me questions.  What do you do?  I said I gave him my card again.  Business card.  He says, Mate, I'm a plumber.  I have a website.  I need that updating.  I said I can do that for you.  So he had three different websites.  So I did that work, gave him a job.  And then he introduced me to his father, who was  also doing self managed super fund something accounting type business.  And he said, My wife, uh, sorry.  My, uh, father also needs a website, uh, update.  I said, Sure, I'll do that for him as well.  So I went and saw him, and, uh, I met  him at the cafe.  I didn't have office.  Only have a laptop and a business card.  He called his son.  He says call, call.  It calls.  This boy is asking advance.  Is he?  I was like, It's a slang.  And the colleague says, Yeah, he reid is give him  advice.  No problem.  After that, I asked Colin, What was your father who  was asking?  He says, Means is he a good bloke?  Can I trust him?  Because he's asking for advanced money.  He doesn't even have an office.  And and he's asking for money right now before doing  the work and everything.  Can I trust him?  He said, Yeah, yeah, he's a good guy.  Give him the money.  He'll deliver the work and everything.  And I got my third project that way." metadata={}

He said, Yeah, yeah, he's a good guy.  Give him the money.  He'll deliver the work and everything.  And I got my third project that way.  But one thing I learned from that time that in  Australia you had only remember two things.  The first customer service is shit here.  Yeah, And if you do a good customer service, you  are already a winner, right or wrong?  Yeah.  You just have to do a good customer service right  here.  And second thing you had to deliver Deliver in the  sense.  If you promise something you deliver, you took money.  You had to do the job.  Yeah, you deliver.  And when I do these two things, we still have  the successful business running.  So when you find the first customer, do good customer  service and deliver, and that will give you a second  that will give you third.  That will give you fourth and be a rigid rigid  is means be a good bloke, trustworthy.  And that's your formula to success in business.  Just do a good job.  Does that answer?  Yeah.  OK, uh, let me move a little bit here.  This side.  Then we'll come back to this side.  There was a hand raised here somewhere.  Yeah, uh-huh, um, her questions.  And she is since you've done have you have you,  have you jump around?  If I ask you what's next for you?  What do you think?  What's the next step?  No.  Well, there is a time where you are looking unsure  and you're looking what I wanna do next.  And then there is a time where next comes to  you You don't have to think of it.  So there's a matching effect, which means you reach to  the level where network was to connect with you.  You don't have to go out to connect.  You don't have to go to network.  It's like, uh uh if you have 15 followers, 1500  followers, the next 500 will be easier.  But if you don't have even five, the next 500  will be difficult for your 1st 500 right?  Same way in opportunity land.  You don't have to go out and look for opportunity  knocks on your door then later on You reach at  that level and I have reached at the level where  I actually have a lot of opportunity in front of  me and I'm learning to say no.  But in terms of your professional life No, If if  you if you if you look at the industry, I  have always been in it industry, right?  Yeah, of course.  I had to do a few jobs here and there  to pay my bills.  When you lost the business, you you had to go  back to printing.  But that was for three months.  But what I have done consistently is focus on my  tech sector and I have built business.  And I have always done business, always been entrepreneurial, so  I haven't Of course, I had to go and work  sometimes to pay the bills and do jobs.  But I have always been entrepreneurial and doing business in  what tech sector.  But on the right side.  Sorry.  On the left side, you saw a lot of volunteering  I've been doing.  But if you look at the volunteering I've been doing  again, that's back into the community, which is to do  with the education with the tech sector to do with  their work programmes or to do with the, uh, uh,  disability community, which we have a product for, or indigenous  community, which we have a product for and everything.  So if you look very closely, it looks quite a  lot.  But the theme is the central theme is the same  tech social impact.  Oh yeah, very happy with where I am and what  I have achieved and what I'm doing.  And and right now, actually, it's not to do more.  It's to do less where you you reach a certain  level in life where you have to learn to say  no and you have to do less less is more,  which means if you are good at something, there's exp  There's a thing called to learn, exploit and, um, explore.  Exploration is you always try new new things, different time  all the time and exploring and you don't know what's  going to hit.  Exploit is when you have learned something which is working  and it is good and you want to exploit more,  which means you want to take more advantage of that  and do something good, right, And that's the leadership training  that W what kind of person you are where you  in your life in your professional journey are you are  at always exploration stage or you exploitation stage.  So I would say right now I'm 20% exploration.  Don't mind trying one or two different things, but 80%  I'm in exploitation stage, which means something is amazingly working.  The business has reached the half the potential.  It has more potential to reach another half and next  10 years by 2050 Aumar solution We already had four  offers to get acquired and purchase and people want to  buy our IP.  We don't want to sell.  We don't want to get acquired.  We don't want to merge.  We don't want to have exit strategy.  We don't want to get an exit listed.  So there is still more potential in the business for  the next 10 years.  Right?  So that means exploiting the business which is already doing  good out there.  Exploration to stay relevant as Alex mentioned before, you need  to move into the AWS, not just Microsoft.  You have to stay relevant to the time.  Yeah, tomorrow Blockchain application.  We might do so.  Then you are exploring a little bit more, but within  the same tech world which you are comfortable with.  Exploration versus exploration.  So I would say 20%.  We are exploring looking for new opportunities.  But at the same time, we are staying true to  who we are and what we know the best.  Hold their answers.  Yeah, One at the back.  Um, I have a two part question, if I may  1st thing is, uh how did you manage to, uh,  spend all this stuff and personal environment course.  Um, doing, uh, freelancer and charity work for volunteering and  also be able to hold your obligation university and a  university student.  Have you heard of IOXB?  No.  It's a bomb tiger bomb, which you apply it to  your back every evening and your legs because it's paining.  Yeah.  So six in the morning, I leave at 11 o'clock.  I come at home with 50 different business cards in  my home, and I must have attended three different events  and I would have not missed a single lecture.  And I would have gone to many meetings and I  would have done everything by the time my day finishes.  And it's the same thing happens right now.  Yeah, I still have a physio and I'm still out  there.  I'm still doing exercising.  I'm still working.  I'm still eating.  But it's no easy road to success.  Hard work, a lot of hard work.  And anybody says that work life balance is bullshit.  Yeah, there is no balance.  Yeah, there's no balance.  Work life, that's That's the That's not a concept.  Work, life balance.  You have a real hard work behind you.  It doesn't come easy.  Attending 50 events throughout the week and networking and delivering  work and doing a lot of meetings doesn't come easy.  If anybody says that you succeed overnight No, no, no,  no, no.  A lot of work behind and balancing in the sense  Never, ever miss your lecture because that's where you learn  the most and you interact the most.  And you have two way communication.  Yeah, never miss the lecture.  Second, always read your slide deck before you come to  the lecture.  Because if" metadata={}

A lot of work behind and balancing in the sense  Never, ever miss your lecture because that's where you learn  the most and you interact the most.  And you have two way communication.  Yeah, never miss the lecture.  Second, always read your slide deck before you come to  the lecture.  Because if you have read it already and you know  what to expect, you have done 30% 40% of the  job already.  By understanding what you're going to get, learn and when  you come to the lecture, you have already learned another  half and then 20% is before the exam.  You are going on YouTube and learning it again, right?  So I have always took advantage of the lecture rooms  and prep preparing and then doing a little bit of  work before the exam and passing.  And I always wanted to pass.  I was never interested in high distinction or distinctions because,  uh, every students, uh, I, I appreciate the average students,  you know, just passing.  Yeah, but guess what.  I did have high distinction distinctions and few units and  everything, but I was always interested in passing so that  I don't have to pay my unit fees again.  Yeah, so I wasn't the first class student, but I  was never failed either.  My question is that, um it seems that you chose  a career path and you start a business and promote  that business.  Some people, including myself, are more focused on actually value  graduate university, I gradually raising that level until I can  have enough money to spend I my own business.  But I don't have to do the trial and error  thing.  What is your?  If you were to advise someone on that, it's an  entrepreneurial mindset which you need Just because you are working  doesn't mean you don't have to be an entrepreneurial mindset.  Entrepreneurs are solving problems.  They are always looking for opportunity.  And when you are working in a business, you are  always going to go to some business.  And as an employee you can be an entrepreneur.  Yeah, you are an entrepreneur within the organisation.  But you are an entrepreneur, which means that you are  always helping business to do better, to do more to  solve problem.  And that's the mindset you need to develop.  It doesn't matter whether you are running or your own  business or you are becoming part of another business.  But you need a mindset where you are always solving  problems and you're helping businesses, whether it's your business or  somebody else's business.  But you are helping business.  And that's the mindset I always had.  Entrepreneur.  So you don't have to be either or one.  Yeah, be an entrepreneur if you cannot be an entrepreneur.  OK, let's go back here.  I have a question.  Uh, you mentioned firstly you said that you outsourcing the  job, right?  Yeah.  When I came here, I had a team in India  which I was getting things done 80 2020% I pay  in India to get things done and 80% I make  money here.  So I charge you $100.  I pay $20 and I make $80.  Of course, deliver on your promise.  Everything.  So client engagement, sales, project management, business analysis, quality control.  I talk to the client, gather the requirement.  I talk to the development team and get things done  and come and deliver and make sure it's delivered in  the way customer wanted.  So you had to learn to do everything.  Not just one thing.  Yeah, I had I had a team of people there,  so I used to have a few people who are  managing the rest of the team.  If you have a one or two project manager in  India who can be your connection and then they can  talk to the local team and explain everything development team  and get things done.  Then you have one or two people like that personally  to work with.  And I had those people.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  OK, I think we're running out of time.  So one more last question.  Anybody?  Sorry.  Definitely not only discount, but the free shipping.  So what's happening is book topia, which is like an  Amazon of Australia.  Uh, they have 6 million books in their database.  That's the largest inventory.  They got 6 million books and out of that 497  books.  No, Uh, no.  397 books under just under 403 197 books.  They selected to be the best seller, and they offered  12 13% discount plus free shipping.  And my book is one of that.  So if you go to book here on, uh uh,  online and type Terminal four on Google Book Book, then  you'll see the discount already applied.  And free shipping already applied.  And they are the one running that campaign, so it's  already there.  Oh, there's one more last question.  OK, then we'll finish Good working.  Hm?  Yeah, So that's a good question.  I didn't have IT background.  I was a school failure, but I learned to do  a bit of a programming and coding and, uh uh,  graphic design animation Internet in 1999 when I was a  hardware engineer and was self taught, a lot of things  was self learning.  Um, regardless of what do you have?  Background.  You have something specific to you.  You have some skill inside you which you are born  with which you are specialised in.  Uh, either you could be an artist or you could  be a singer.  You could be a runner.  You could be a a great problem solver.  Every each one of you has something specific to you  which you know what you are good at.  Who knows you the best yourself, right?  Because who spends the most time with you?  You right?  You know what food you like.  What makes you angry?  What makes you happy?  What makes you sad?  There's something inside you which is very unique to you.  Which is something good about you that you are really  good at.  And it comes naturally, naturally to you.  Second nature to you.  If if that task comes to you, you'll do really  well.  Each one of you will have something.  And for me, sales and business development was natural to  me.  I can connect with people easily.  I can strike up the conversation.  I can hold the conversation, I can find the opportunity  and I can build upon that opportunity.  That was very natural to me, even in school before  even I have IT background.  Even in school, I used to sell, uh uh, stickers,  glowy stickers.  Yeah, and ball pens I used to sell and everything.  So that was something you, as a child was unique  to you.  And that's regardless of your education background or your work  background.  There's something unique about you, which is you are good  at.  And eventually everybody will find something about them either early  in life or late in life.  But all of us have something special about us, which  we are good at.  Find that and combine that with work and magic happens.  Yeah.  Ask yourself a question.  What?  What?  I really am good at something good.  And I wanna find something similar to that not because  of the society tells me, or what family tells me  or what university tells me or what the course is  trying to tell me.  I know something good about myself, and I wanna connect  that with the work or university degree I'm doing.  But find that first inside you here and you know  yourself best not outside inward Answer is inward, not outside.  Right.  Is there a a deep, deep answer, but hopefully you'll  find a way to uncover that." metadata={}
