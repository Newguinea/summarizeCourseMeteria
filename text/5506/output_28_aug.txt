page_content="So to start with beekeeping, I mean, it seems a  bit odd that we are talking about beekeeping in a  unit which is Internet of things.  But I'll try and make a connection between the two.  So we start with the fundamental question of why whatever  we want to do, we want to know, Why are  we doing it so beekeeping?  It's nothing new.  At the time, Egyptians were building pyramids.  They had these domestic bees.  So domestic bees have survived for thousands of years.  They are not new, But why should we worried about  them?  Now there's a lot of people talking about bees.  The reason is because bees are very important in pollination.  Almost one third of whatever we eat depends upon honey  bee pollination.  If we take honeybees out of the equation.  One third of our food is gone.  And because of the climate change, forest fires other diseases.  Bees are not doing very well.  And if bees go extinct, we will be in a  lot of trouble.  So that's why we have to take care of our  bees.  Traditionally, how it is done.  It is very, very manual and back bending work.  A beekeeper will go to the beehive.  Beehives have multiple supers or boxes.  As you call them.  You open the lid, you have access to the frames.  You take out one frame, scan through it, see how  bees are doing.  Is there enough food and nectar in there?  Do we have young bees and eggs or not?  And they go through this each and every frame.  These hives can be heavy, so it's difficult work and  it takes a lot of time.  They also have to search for the queen whether it  is laying eggs or not.  So it takes a lot of time and manual hard  work to inspect a beehive.  Uh, secondly, whenever you open a beehive for inspection, bees  actually have to repair the hive from inside because they  will wax every little opening with the bee glue so  that they have their own environment.  And if I am opening a hive every day for  an inspection, let's say I have this much time.  I'm actually forcing the bees to repair their house each  and every day, and they cannot get back to their  usual work.  So it is not possible to have these inspections every  day.  Usually they are done fortnight every two weeks or so  also beehives.  If you and I were a hobby beekeeper, it's OK.  We can have a couple of hives at the back  of our house.  We can manage that.  But if you're a commercial beekeeper, you are doing one  of the two number one you are collecting, honey, which  you are selling Number two.  You are providing pollination services to the farmers, and that  is actually a much bigger industry.  Honey is just a byproduct, and for these, what you  have to do is you have to move your hives  to the places.  For example, if you are after Jara honey, you have  to move your hives to Jarrah Forest.  If you're providing pollination services to a canola farmer who  is 300 kilometres away.  You have to move your hives there.  And if you are based in Perth and you want  to inspect your hives, you have to travel long distances.  Go there regularly check up on your hives.  That means manual inspection requires a lot of, uh, travelling  as well.  And as a beekeeper, when you're inspecting the hive, you  have to go through 100 hives each day after a  few hives.  If you're tired, there is a good chance that you  may miss upon what is happening inside the hive.  There may be an obvious sign that this hive is  sick.  You may have a look, but you may not notice  it and put it down.  So there are certain limitations with traditional methods of beekeeping  as well.  Before we go further into what beekeeping is, we have  to how these beehive monitoring work.  We have to understand the bees and how their life  cycle works and everything starts with a queen.  Every hive has one queen, the single most important bee  inside the hive.  And the only job of the queen is to lay  eggs these eggs, lava and pupa.  They are collectively called the brood.  This takes about three weeks of time before they hatch  as hive bees.  These hive bees stay inside the hive and do hive  chores, such as cleaning the hive, regulating the temperature.  They do it about four weeks, and all of these  numbers of hive bees impact how the hive is doing  how the brood is doing.  After four weeks, these bees convert into foragers.  What is the job of foragers?  Go out, find food, which is pollen and nectar.  The food they bring back is used by the hive,  the lava, the pupa.  This food is used inside, and after about two weeks  of foraging activity, the bee dies.  So it's a very short life span of around nine  weeks.  But environment plays a crucial role.  For example, if temperatures are too high or too low,  the bees inside the hive, the little ones, they will  die.  The environment is also responsible of providing food.  If there's not enough food, bees will die.  Or if a farmer is using pesticides, which are not  suitable for bees, bees will get sick and they will  die.  So environment impacts a lot.  So if we take a quick look inside the hive,  these are pictures from a few frames here on the  top part, Uh, the, uh, small part.  You can see some pollen.  Uh, the cap nectar is the white part, and the  brown part bottom is the brood that is inside their  lava, and they are ready to hatch here.  There are some, uh, bees which are hatching, and here  we have a frame which is full of honey.  So let's come to the electronic monitoring of beehives.  So every electronic monitoring system has four fundamental components electronic  sensors which we place inside or around the hive, a  communication mechanism which carries the data to a user, uh,  to a data storage.  Then we have some sort of processing to extract information  from this data.  And then there's a user interface where beekeeper can access  this information and see what is going on.  Then we have advanced components such as wireless sensor networks  between different hives.  We want to have long distance monitoring capability in that  these systems are connected with Internet and beekeeper can access  the hive data using a Web interface from anywhere in  the world.  And last is the health status prediction, which, uh is  a new and hot topic where we try to use  machine learning to predict what's going to happen in the  future so that we can anticipate and beekeeper can take  appropriate actions.  What are the four major aims of electronic monitoring of  beehives?  Number one, Since we are putting sensors inside the hive  now we do not have to open the hive to  see what is going on.  C sensors are inside and they will continuously monitor the  hives.  So around the clock monitoring and because of this continuous  monitoring, we are able to detect diseases as they come.  If I was a beekeeper and I were to inspect  hives and every two weeks if something happens in between,  I will not know.  But sensors, they can pick that up.  Then again, we can use this electronic sensor data for  health status prediction.  And the most important bit of all the aim of  these monitoring systems is to minimise the time and cost  of your operation.  Because if I come up with a system which is  very expensive, beekeepers will not buy it, it goes to  waste.  So we want the system to be cost effective.  Now, this is a question that whenever you are about  to design a monitoring system, it doesn't matter.  It's a beehive monitoring system or a house monitoring system.  You have to answer this question.  Which sensor should I use?  And for this you have to do some background study  for me.  I had to study bees.  You may have to study something else and then find  out which sensors will be the most effective set of  solutions to monitor this thing for bees.  If we categorise these sensors into three categories very high  relevance, which is temperature weight of high internal imaging, then  there are some sensors with high relevance, and then some  are there with medium relevance.  These are a lot of sensors.  I do not have time to go through all of  them, but I will try and go through a few  of them as we go through this, uh, lecture number  one temperature temperature is one of the most important parameters  inside the beehive because the brood the young one to  hatch properly, they need a temperature of around 35 degrees,  and bees work very hard to regulate this temperature.  I'll try and explain this using an example.  Let's say this lecture theatre Let's say it has no  air conditioning at all, and we have to maintain a  temperature of around 35 degrees.  There are some kids here who need that temperature, and  if it gets too cold, what we do is we  all come together.  Put the Children in the middle, make a big circle  around them and use our body heat to keep them  warm.  That is what bees do.  They actually use their body heat and metabolism and movement  to keep the high warm when it is too cold.  If it gets too hot, some of the bees go  at the hive entrance and use their wings to cause  a fresh flow of air into the hive.  They ventilate the air inside the hive to bring the  temperature down, and it is very hard work.  Only a healthy colony is able to regulate its temperature  better, so if you monitor the temperature and it is  steady at 35 °C, that means it is a healthy  colony.  That's why it is able to regulate the temperature.  But if we are monitoring the temperature and we see  huge fluctuations in that, that means it is a weak  colony and unable to regulate the temperature.  And what happens if the temperature is not regulated properly?  If the variation is too high, the brood will die.  But if the variation is within a few degrees centigrade,  the brood which hatches it is not very healthy.  When it goes out, it will spend a lot of  time roaming around.  It will not bring back enough food and nectar back  to the hive, so weak colony starts when the temperature  is not regulated properly.  No, we can study and find out.  OK, these are the, uh, sensors that are very, very  relevant.  But in" metadata={}

It will not bring back enough food and nectar back  to the hive, so weak colony starts when the temperature  is not regulated properly.  No, we can study and find out.  OK, these are the, uh, sensors that are very, very  relevant.  But in a practical word, relevance is not enough.  You have to find sensors which are also practical, that  can be deployed.  Let's take the case of internal imaging on paper.  If I say OK, let's put a camera inside the  hive and live stream whatever bees are doing and the  beekeeper can see what is going on.  The problem is solved, right?  Beekeeper can constantly see what is happening inside the hive,  and our problem is solved.  But there are problems with internal imaging.  First of all, these cameras, internal cameras, they are not  cheap.  If you put them in it will cost you a  lot.  The amount of electricity they use that is quite high.  So if you have a remote deployment, you have a  limited supply of energy.  A small battery.  How will you operate these cameras?  These cameras generate images or videos that you have to  transmit them to the beekeeper.  How will you do that?  Because there is a transmission cost and energy cost associated  with that.  And then we have to consider bees as well.  Bees will cover any alien object with B vax.  You put a camera in and after a few days  the camera lens is covered with B vax and you  cannot see anything.  So despite it being a very, very relevant sensor, it  is very, very difficult to use.  So that's why it is has a very low productivity.  If you see overall usability rating of internal imaging towards  the end, that has only one star.  So when it comes when we talk about challenges number  one we have to find out which sensors are relevant.  We have to study bees for that.  Then we have to take practical considerations, uh, and see  which sensors can be used.  And then there is this thing about cost and accuracy?  I can get a temperature sensor, which is very, very  accurate, but costs, let's say, $10.  And there's one which is less accurate but costs only  $1.  And as I said, overall, overall cost of the system  is important.  I will actually go for a $1 sensor and compromise  a bit of on the accuracy because I want the  overall cost of the sensor to be in a range  that beekeeper can afford.  So we have to find a balance between cost and  accuracy.  Power consumption is another problem.  At remote sites, there is no AC power available.  You have to either rely on energy harvesting using solar  panels.  Even in that case, there will be rainy days when  there will be no, uh, solar panel Will will not  operate properly so that your system should be very, very  power efficient.  So whatever small battery it has, it should be able  to last.  Uh, then there is this problem of data transmission, and  it is very much significant in Australia because if you  travel a few hours outside any major city you have  no four G coverage.  How do you transmit the data, This becomes a problem.  Uh, and when you transfer the data, it has the  cost that you have to pay as, uh to the  four G network provider.  And it consumes a lot of power as well.  So if we talk about communication, satellite communication is an  option.  But it is expensive.  Then the alternate is four G.  And if we look at the three G, four G  and five G coverage map of Australia, you will see  the big cities are covered, the major highways are covered.  But there are a lot of areas where the coverage  is not appropriate and beekeepers often deploy their hives in  these areas.  Now there is another alternate that's called NBI OT Narrow  Band, Internet of things.  And you look, if you look at the coverage map  of NBI OT just have a comparison significantly larger area  for NBI OT.  So it solves the coverage problem.  But NBI OT has a limitation.  It can only handle small amounts of data.  I cannot use NBI OT for anything which is big.  So you have to If I want to use NBI  OT, I have to design the system in a way  that it generates only small amounts of data that can  be transmitted using NBI OT.  So what were the research questions that I tried to  answer during my PhD?  First of all, was which sensor should be used while  keeping the design cost of the system low number one  and number two.  That system should be able to remote work in remote  regions of Australia.  And if we are using NBI OT, it should generate  a small amount of data.  Secondly, is it possible to reduce the system design cost  using soft sensor predictions?  I mean, if there is a sensor which is very,  very expensive, is there an alternate?  Can we use some other means to find the value  of that sensor without using that sensor that will bring  the cost of the system down?  And last one is, hm?  Can machine learning algorithms be used to assist in the  selection of the sensors for a specific task and help  fine tune the design of beehive monitoring system?  So as we go through, we will see how I  try to answer these questions during my PhD.  Uh, this was a system that I designed, uh was  based on a micro controller.  Uh, 48 megahertz, decent amount of ram.  All the sensors.  Some were connected using I Square CBU.  Some were connected using SP interface.  There was a battery solar panel weighing scale.  And for the system design we use off the shelf  components.  I did not choose anything which was difficult to buy  or not available.  All the components were very easily available.  We design our own two layer PC B as a  motherboard for these, uh, sensors.  This was our very first design.  We have moved on, and I'll show you in a  while.  Uh, we this is the sensor system that you can  see.  It used to be.  I mounted it on a side.  It was taking up quite a bit of space in  the frame, which we do not want.  But in later versions, we have actually used the size  of the sensor system.  Mhm.  Uh, we tried to keep the system as much power  efficient as possible, so it had a 2% duty cycle.  So my sensor system will wake up every 10 minutes,  collect data and go to sleep again.  And the data collection and transmission cycle took around 12  seconds.  So This comes to 2 2% duty cycle.  We used feature extraction, so I did record audio of  the bees inside the beehive, but audio signal, it is  quite heavy.  So what I did was using a microprocessor within the  monitoring system.  I extracted important features from this audio signal and transmitted  only those important features which were used down to a  few bytes.  So I was at every 10 minutes I was collecting  a total of six kilobytes of data and then reducing  it down to 91 bytes of data that was to  be transmitted.  So for audio signals and vibration data, we used four  transform and found out what were the key values at  certain frequencies and transmitted only those for communication.  We use NBI, OT and Laura, uh, both of them.  Laura is very, very suitable because it is actually practically  free.  But there are some range of limitations with that, and  you also have to deploy a Laura Gateway, which is  at this point of time not readily available.  But in future, I think it will be available in  lots of places.  Then we identified.  We evaluated nine different" metadata={}

But in future, I think it will be available in  lots of places.  Then we identified.  We evaluated nine different sensors using this system and 40  different features, and then we found out which is useful  and which is not.  And since we are trying to find out which sensors  should be used, whether machine learning can be used or  not.  For all of this you need data, and that is  very important part.  So we spent considerable amount of time about 18 months  to collect data from eight different hives.  These hives were deployed at different sites at different time,  and we had, in the end, total 2170 days of  data.  And using this data, we actually trained our models.  So one of the data which is very, very important  is hive weight.  So this is the weight of a hive on three  different days on June, which is 4th, 5th and 6th  of June.  And these are the daily weight variations of the hive.  And if you look closely here between eight and 9  p.m. you see a sharp dip in the high weight.  And this is when the bees the foragers leave the  hive in large number, and that actually reduces the weight  of the hive.  And when the bees return to the high weight pollen  and nectar.  We can see the hive weight going up after evening.  The hive loses weight because bees inside are consuming food,  converting it into energy.  The hive, the water content in the nectar is also  evaporating.  And that's also causing a decrease in the weight.  So we see these fluctuations every day here.  If you see, on sixth of June, you can see  some odd variations in the high weight.  And if I pull the rain data for the same  day, we can see it actually rained.  So when it rains, sometimes the water can form puddles  on top of the hives.  Then it can drip.  So these external parameters, they impact the hive weight a  lot.  And how do we measure the high weight?  Uh, these are the hives.  When they were deployed at UW a.  And underneath each hive, you can see this metallic aluminium  thing that is the hive scale.  The thing about these hive scales is they are quite  big, about the same size as the hive.  They are heavy 6 to 7 kilogrammes, and they are  very expensive to make.  Because these hives are deployed outdoors, they have to endure  all the harsh weather conditions And since we had them  made at UW, it cost me around $700 for one  hive scale.  So this is a significant cost for a beekeeper.  We know that we want to measure the weight because  it is important.  But at the same time, weighing scales are so expensive.  Now, that soft sensing that I talked about a while  ago comes into that question.  Can we use some techniques to estimate the weight of  the hive without using the weighing scale?  And if we can do that, that means beekeeper will  get the information that they want.  That is the weight of the hive.  But the cost of these weighing skills will not be  included in the setup.  And that is what actually we try to do.  We try to estimate the high weight.  So the system you see, this is our second revision.  We actually went to a much smaller single PC B.  Uh, it takes much less space inside the hive and  using the data collected collected from the sensor system data  collected from the weather stations, we used artificial intelligence or  machine learning.  And then we estimated the high weight I will very  quickly go through what machine learning or artificial intelligences?  Let's say we have a hive and we have sensor  system deployed inside the hive and using that sensor system,  we are collecting some sensor data in the parallel.  What we will do is we will engage some beekeepers  to inspect those hives on regular basis and provide us  the assessment of hive whether the hive is healthy or  not, if the queen is laying eggs or not.  And we provide both of these things the sensor data  and the information about the hive to a machine learning  algorithm.  And if we have enough quality and quantity of the  training data machine learning algorithm tries to find a relationship  between the two.  So if the hive assessment was good, what was the  sensor data?  If the hive assessment was bad, what was the sensor  data?  And once it has learned this relationship, we can take  the beekeeper out of the equation.  And just by using the sensor data, the machine learning  algorithm can generate an assessment which would be like that  of a beekeeper.  So now the beekeeper does not have to go and  check up on the hive.  We collect the data using sensor system.  Feed that data into a machine learning algorithm.  And that algorithm generates an assessment which is similar to  that of a beekeeper.  Uh, I will not be going into many technical details  of this system, but here we have some hives.  We collect sensor data from the hive.  We extract features, we pass it to our deep model,  which is based on two parallel encoders.  And then this is the output that we get.  The green weight is actually the actual weight of the  hive.  The actual variation of the hive per frame and the  red one is our estimation.  And we can see we estimated something, which was very,  very similar.  Is it always the same?  No.  I'm going to skip the technical, uh uh, specifications of  the system here.  Uh, if we look at the just the numbers in  the red circle you see 0.55 that is the percentage  error.  So we had the actual data from the hive.  We data.  We also had the estimations.  And when we calculated the error, our errors were 0.55%  on average.  So less than 1% of errors.  So here are some examples of actual weight of the  hive and the hive weight estimations in a and B,  you can see our estimations are quite accurate.  Whatever actual weight of the high was, our model is  able to generate very, very similar estimates.  But in example, C and B our estimates.  At the end of the day, we can see an  error that is marked by the red circle.  And if we are to track the weight of high  for multiple days, how do we do that?  We connect all of these estimations with each other, and  if there is an error each day positive, positive, positive.  After multiple days, that error can really blow out of  proportions.  So what I did was I actually saw what is  the error profile.  And this is the profile or error histogram of our  data for all the days.  And if you look at this histogram, it has a  Gaussian shape which is centred around zero.  What it means is that I have some days error,  which is positive.  That means I'm saying, OK, the high weight is more  than normal.  On some days, I'm saying high weight is less than  normal.  So my errors are both positive and negative.  So what this does is that in the long run,  if I stitch a lot of weights together, sometimes it  is over.  Predict predicting.  Sometimes it is under predicting, and as a result, a  lot of these errors cancel each other out.  And here is the weight of a hive track for  300 days and you can see the actual weight and  the estimated weight.  They are quite similar Now.  There's one question here.  What are these sharp changes in the weight of the  hive.  So beekeepers do not just" metadata={}

So what I did was I actually saw what is  the error profile.  And this is the profile or error histogram of our  data for all the days.  And if you look at this histogram, it has a  Gaussian shape which is centred around zero.  What it means is that I have some days error,  which is positive.  That means I'm saying, OK, the high weight is more  than normal.  On some days, I'm saying high weight is less than  normal.  So my errors are both positive and negative.  So what this does is that in the long run,  if I stitch a lot of weights together, sometimes it  is over.  Predict predicting.  Sometimes it is under predicting, and as a result, a  lot of these errors cancel each other out.  And here is the weight of a hive track for  300 days and you can see the actual weight and  the estimated weight.  They are quite similar Now.  There's one question here.  What are these sharp changes in the weight of the  hive.  So beekeepers do not just leave their hive.  And during different seasons they have different number of boxes.  And in winter, when the bees generating a lot of  honey, after every few months or a month, they will  take a hive, which is full of honey off, and  put an empty hive.  So that actually creates a change in the weight of  the hive, and we can see these changes.  Whenever you add something to the hive, it will go  up.  If you take something off from the hive, the hive  weight will go down.  Then the last part, I will again quickly go through.  This one was if we can use machine learning to  optimise our monitoring system.  What are we trying to optimise here?  Our goals were make a system which consumes less power,  have a system which is not very costly.  And we want to use machine learning for that.  What actually did was we use machine learning to evaluate  the performance of our system and each sensor individually.  What we see here is a daily map and I  use on an average data that what times are most  important for collecting the be sensor data And this map  is generated using an A I model.  We train the model and we looked inside what it  has learned and this is what the model has learned.  And the white circles you see show us that the  data collected at between five and 6 a.m. and the  data collected around 4 p.m. that is very, very important  because at this point of time, bees are very active,  The nectar is available in the flowers and bees can  go and collect that and that actually causes a significant  change in the high weight.  Now, what can we do using this data?  Let's say you have this information that bees are very  active at this time.  What can we do?  Any suggestions?  Anyone?  OK, we have this information that these are very active  between five and 6 a.m. and between three and 4  p.m. With this information, can we do something to help  our monitoring system?  Sorry.  Say that again.  Yep.  So if we know what times bees are more active  I have to.  I can collect more data at this time and less  data otherwise.  This way.  Whenever I am spending energy on collecting the data, that  energy is well utilised.  When bees are more active, collect more data during the  nighttime.  Bees are not active.  Do I have to collect data every time?  Minutes?  No.  I can collect data every one hour interval.  But at this point of time, I can say OK,  I have to collect data at every five minute interval.  So using this information, you we can optimise the collection  time of our sensor system and make better use of  energy that we are utilising.  This is another map attention map.  And this is based on the features that we used.  And on the top left quadrant, we can see the  values are much higher compared to the other three quadrants.  So that means that the sensors that are here carry  much more information than the other sensors.  And what we can do is if a sensor is  not contributing at all towards weight estimation, we can move  it out of the system.  And once you do that, we are reducing the system  design cost because there is one less sensor.  That sensor was consuming power.  We are saving on power.  That sensor was generating data that we were transmitting.  We are saving on the data transmission as well.  Similarly, if we find out that a sensor is collecting  five different features, three of them are useful.  Two are not.  We can stop collecting those two features that will save  us the processing that is used to extract those features  that will also save us on the data plan because  we have now less features to transmit.  So we did exactly that.  We re modified our system and we said OK, now  we are only going to use this set of sensors  and features and this was the attention map and now  we can see there are much fewer darker regions in  here, but we are not yet sure whether we have  removed the sensors correctly or not.  So what we did was we actually evaluated the system  again, using these very selected features.  And if we look at the results, we have two  columns here, one with all features and one with reduced  features.  And if we compare the results, the results are very,  very similar.  There may be a certain decline of 0.2 grammes in  first case, but given the gain that we had by  removing the so many extra redundant sensors, this is worth  it.  So this is how we use the machine learning algorithm  to optimise our system.  So to conclude what we did was, we designed a  beehive monitoring system with a focus on Australian needs.  Because the commercial monitoring system which are available we are  not the first ones to make a beehive monitoring system,  a tonne of them are available, but most of them  originate from Europe and America.  They either use four G communication and or WiFi communication,  and the four G communication systems do not work here.  So we had to come up with a system which  would use NBI OT, which is available in Australia.  And because of NBI OT, we had to redesign everything  so that it consumes less amount of power generates less  amount of data.  We also developed the first A I model for be  weight estimation to bring the cost of the monitoring system  down.  Uh, we are the first one to leverage NBI OD  communication for beehive monitoring.  And then we also showcase that these a i models  they are not just good for predictions.  They can actually be used to optimise actual hardware monitoring  systems.  Now, if I were to take away a few points  from this, that would be whenever you are about to  tackle a problem.  First thing you have to see is is it at  a level that you can solve it.  For example, we started with the problem of there is  not enough food in the world.  We want to make sure there is enough food for  everyone.  Is that a problem I can solve?  No.  But then OK, I start digging.  Deep food depends upon a lot of things.  30% of it depends upon honey bee pollination, but I  am not in that area.  I'm not researching on honeybees.  There's nothing I can do directly to honeybees.  I cannot modify their genetics.  What I can do is I can contribute to a  tool which helps monitor the honeybees.  So I broke it down.  The problem came down to a level which was related  to electronics engineering in my field.  And then I said, OK, now I can solve this  problem and then to solve this problem, you don't just  say OK, this is a problem.  I'm going to buy a bunch of sensors that I  can find and I'll put them together and the problem  will be solved.  Now you have to understand the problem so that you  can find the right set of sensors and then you  can make a system which is actually of some use.  Then you also have to step in the shoes of  the end user.  For me, I had to talk to a lot of  beekeepers and understand what they hit.  They absolutely hate wires.  So if my monitoring system has a lot of wires  coming in and out, they will not like it.  If it has a lot of costs, they will not  like it.  If it has any external antenna," metadata={}

So if my monitoring system has a lot of wires  coming in and out, they will not like it.  If it has a lot of costs, they will not  like it.  If it has any external antenna, that will be a  problem when they transport the hives.  So I have to design a system which actually meets  the specifications of the end user.  We have to put the customer the end user first.  Then we define our objectives and say, OK, this is  these are the things that we want to do for  me.  The objectives were have a monitoring system which is low  cost.  Secondly, it works in Australia.  And to achieve these objectives did I start designing a  new communication system.  No NBI OT and Laura.  They are already available along with a bunch of others.  I studied those systems and I narrowed it down.  OK, these two systems are good because I can use  them and they will solve my problem.  Similarly, with machine learning models, I have not designed anything  new in the machine learning models.  There are plenty of them out there are available.  I studied them and I said, OK, these are the  ones they can solve My problem.  I'll have to tweak them a little, and that's what  I did.  I modified those systems so that they work for my  needs and in the end I achieve my goals.  Uh, before we go into questions.  You are asking questions.  I have one question from you.  So the title of this talk was Internet of beehives.  What do you think is missing from the design?  Or how the connectivity of this system can be improved.  So both of these.  The answer to the first part is also related to  connectivity.  We are talking about Internet of beehives.  Whatever I have explained here, do you see something which  is missing?  Oh, you mention about my future.  Are we going to utilise this in the future?  Of course.  Uh, I'm talking about more about connectivity in future.  What do you mean by future?  That's a good question.  You can ask that later, but I'm talking about whatever  we have implemented up until now.  Nothing in the future.  Is there a key feature which is missing in this  design?  That's my question.  Me?  Sorry.  Uh, can you repeat that?  Sorry.  Uh, the connectivity is there to how this communication works  is using NBI OT.  We collect the data, we connect to our MQ TT  host that AQ TT host.  And there is a raspberry pi sitting in the university  that is also connected to the MQ TT host and  whatever data is transmitted, we are logging all the data  here.  I can connect that to anyone so that part of  connectivity is there.  But the thing is, each and every system has a  direct connection to NVIOT and then to my host.  These systems are not talking with each other.  That point is missing.  For example, if I can create a system at a  high side, there are 100 hives and 10 of 10  of them have this monitoring system.  Do I have to use NBI UT for all 10  of them?  Maybe only one of the systems has NBI OT.  The rest of them can talk to that system.  And that system can do the long range transmission because  NBI OT consumes a lot of power.  So if I can use a low power communication between  different hives, data is pulled by one of the system  and that system transmits the data to my host.  That will actually be a good solution.  And that is something that we are working on.  So you can have a look around.  Pass this around.  So this one is the version that we have now.  The next version will be a bit different from this,  but that will be the final version here in the  middle.  That thing you see that can be taken off.  That is the NBI OT module.  So it's, uh, off the shelf solution.  If you want it, you can put it.  If there is no need for NBI OT, you can  take it off.  We have battery here.  Uh, SD card.  The NBI UTIM goes in here.  All the sensors are in here.  This connector here that can be used for the wing  scale, which is external.  So if you want to have a look, please feel  free.  You can pass this around that and I'm open to  Sorry.  Ok, uh, first of all, we will have I think  you more at the end of the up to the  But even at this point, let's have a small platform  system.  And, uh, thank you very much for coming and giving  us a very, very insight.  I have noted a few points which I wanted, because  I am to coordinate with what your project is.  And, um so that you understand What?  Here.  Ok, um, so what?  The one thing which, uh, your project should you will  should be careful is the choice of the censors.  As Umar said, he took a lot of sensors and  there were some criterias on the basis of he decided  that the relevance practically how much it was practical to  use those like the cameras, for example which you gave  the cost and then the accuracy.  That's an issue, which you have.  So do not think every sensor which you see because  you can have many sensors.  So in your project, you should be very careful about  the, uh, about taking that sensor.  So that was also mentioned in his takeaway points, Um,  the data collection to you, as he has shown me  how many days?  300 he collected the data.  So at the end of your project, you should tell  us how much data you have collected and analysed, and  then analysis of that data.  If you see in his whole talk, he has said  how that data is analysed, for example, looking how the  weight is going down.  What are the reason for that going the weight down  of the beehive and looking at different aspects.  And then there was a very important thing that is  the result, the error and the accuracy You have seen  that before.  Machine learning application.  He said, this is the accuracy.  This is the error.  So in your so this we have recorded this presentation.  You can look at the whole scenario whole flow of  this presentation.  And you should know once you would be presenting your  work.  You can take a very good hint from this presentation.  Uh, so with this, uh, I open a question answer  session.  And if you have any question, just feel free to  ask.  There is no bad question, particularly with respect to bees.  So you're welcome to ask any question?  Uh, you're happy.  So we What we did was we had both of  these.  Laura, when we had the systems deployed at UW A.  We were able to use Laura van because there's a  Laura Gateway at UW A.  But when we moved our house to Juan Bay and  other areas, there were no lower gate was available, and  we knew that would happen.  So we had two communication systems in place at places  where Laura Van was available.  We could have used Laura Van where NBI OT was  available.  We could have used NBI OT.  But in the end, to make it consistent, we decided  to go with NBI OT and all the data that  we collected was using NBI OT because having troubleshoot two  systems in a very limited PhD time period, that is  very, very tricky.  But we still are persisting with Laura Van.  The Laura chip is there and if you look at  the board at one end, there is small white antenna  that is Laura Antenna.  And now what we are doing is we are not  using Laura Van Raw Laura for the sensors to talk  with each other.  So this NVIOT board that you see it costs around  1 $40 and if we have this board on each" metadata={}

And now what we are doing is we are not  using Laura Van Raw Laura for the sensors to talk  with each other.  So this NVIOT board that you see it costs around  1 $40 and if we have this board on each  and every system, that is a significant increase in the  cost.  What we are planning is that only one of the  systems at a particular site should have this NBI OT  board and all the other systems can talk to the  system using Lora, which is quite cheap.  And this system will communicate the data from the O  on behalf of our other devices as well.  So in our future plan, we will be using Lara  and NBI OT in a star gateway topology, where all  of these Lora devices connect to this NBI O gateway  and this MNBU gate transfer the data to our server,  right?  We set up a, uh, aura gateway.  No, we will not become, uh, using a dedicated Laura  Gateway.  So each of the boards has a laura antenna and  a Laura chip, and they can talk with each other.  So I can configure the software in one of the  systems to act as a lower gateway, convert the data  into NBUT packet and transmit it further because to set  up a dedicated Lora Gateway, these gateways, they require AC  power, which is not available.  They of most of them require a land cable connection,  which is not available.  So we are modifying and using our own concept of  lower, uh, lower gateway where the back end is based  on NBI OT.  Not our, uh, normal Internet connection.  Yes.  Any other questions?  Yep.  Is this monitored?  It is monitoring in real time.  Uh, what happens is we can have two ways when  it monitors.  We can transmit it as soon as it is recorded.  But one of the biggest things with these real time  transmitters is they consume a lot of time before our  NVIOT can transmit.  It has to establish a connection.  There is some hand shaking and then it transmits the  data.  So that is a lot of overhead.  So what I have done is I can actually just  just a number that I can change in my code  and I can have it transmit at each recorded data.  Right now, what happens is it collects data every 10  minutes and once it has collected six samples, it transmits  all of them together.  So at every one hour, we get six readings and  this way we are able to reduce the overhead of  communication.  But if the power is available in abundance, it is  absolutely possible to transmit as soon as we collect.  But right, OK, that's actually a good question.  So in some of the pictures, I showed you the  system which I had used, and let's start with the  very first slide.  So, looking at this picture, can you get the idea  of how the frames go in and out of the  hive and if you go further, I had my own  frames, which I had a separate compartment where I had  my system mounted, and I covered it with a cloth.  So bees do not distract it.  Uh, be bees.  Do not destroy it or cover it.  Cover it with other stuff.  So it should be E?  Yep.  Here, in this picture, you see the red and blue  part.  That was my PhD monitoring system, which had one motherboard  and all the modules connected and battery connected so it  would be side or on the side of this frame,  and this frame will go into the hive.  Now, the new boards that you see So this is  actually the top bar of the hive.  The hive is quite rectangular, and this is the top  bar.  So we are working on this casing.  The final version is bit different.  So the sensor boards that you see that goes in  here, this thing closes up and this goes into the  hive.  So we have only top part of the hive consumed.  The bees are in here.  So there's some inlet for the air to go in  and out so that we can measure the carbon dioxide  of the stuff some covering.  So this is a work in progress.  But now we have moved to the top part of  the hive No, only one frame in each hive, because  equipping at this point of time equipping each and every  frame, that would be too expensive.  So at this point of time, only one frame in  one hive will have this, and we are targeting.  For example, if a beekeeper has 100 hives at a  site, even if 10 of them have this system, that  is good enough, because that gives you a general idea  of what is going on as the time progress.  For example, if you remember 15, 20 years back, cell  phones were big, heavy, not user friendly, still very expensive.  But as we went into mass production and everyone started  using cell phones, a lot of money went into their  research.  Their size went down, their cost went down.  Same is the case with these monitoring systems.  As beekeepers start to adopt these in large numbers, their  cost will go down, their size will go down, and  there may be a time when these systems may come  embedded in each and every frame that is possible.  But that is not happening in the near future.  It will take a while to get there.  How big is the market?  Uh, it depends upon which beekeeper you are talking to.  If you talk to, uh, old beekeeper who has been  in this business for 2030 years, they are like, No,  we are good with what we have.  If you talk about to a newer beekeeper, someone who  is very eager, they are more open to adopting this  technology and market of this thing depends upon the cost.  If you are able to market a system which costs  $100 I believe every second beekeeper will be up for  it.  Right now, the cost is 607 $100 per system.  And that is high for most of the beekeepers because  they do not see the value in it.  So it depends upon who you are.  Asking this question.  Yes.  Curious how he's gonna know to have somebody around me.  I had to because this project was actually funded by  CRC for honeybee products and we had a beekeeper on  board.  I worked with many commercial beekeepers.  I had to first go and sell my project to  them that this is what I want to do.  Some thought it's because they had to work voluntarily.  I was not paying anyone anything.  So if once someone saw a benefit in it and  they say OK, we can help you because when I  am there I am putting my sensor system in someone's  hive.  I am eating the space from their hive and then  I'm taking their time and a as well help me  put it like this.  I want to go and take it out and every  time they have to do it.  So I had I have worked with a few commercial  beekeepers, but we had one beekeeper which was on board  at UW.  A.  She's still here Tiff me and she helped me a  lot.  So it was a collaborative effort.  I had to.  In the end, I can now manage to open my  own hive, do a few things, but in beekeeping, they  say that it takes about 6 to 7 years of  beekeeping to get to a basic level so I can  open a hive.  But I won't know what is happening If the bees  are healthy or not, it takes a very experienced beekeeper  to have a look and provide that assessment.  So that is not something that I can do, right?  So the data that's been collected, by the way, but  have you collecting damage as you or, uh, So what  sort of data have you collected?  Yep.  So what we did was we collected temperature, humidity, carbon  dioxide, sound vibrations and all of this data actually reflects  upon what bees are doing.  For example, on a very, very on a day where  bees are very active, the sound" metadata={}

So what we did was we collected temperature, humidity, carbon  dioxide, sound vibrations and all of this data actually reflects  upon what bees are doing.  For example, on a very, very on a day where  bees are very active, the sound level will be quite  high inside the hive, the outside temperature will also be  suitable.  So if I have all the data from inside the  hive and the external weather data from a bomb station,  I can actually estimate whether the bees are actively foraging  or not.  And if they are actively foraging, they are bringing the  honey in, and that can be used to estimate whether  the high weight is going up or down.  So we are using all the other sensor data, which  is easy to collect and not that expensive to estimate  the high weight because we had an actual weighing scale  underneath each hive.  So using that actual wing scale, we were collecting that  actual weight data in real time and then we generated  estimates using the internal sensor data.  And then we had both of these to compare.  Yes, our ground growth was actual sensor data, Which was  we Data which was available.  So I had eight of these scales deployed with eight  of these systems.  Yes, Yes, yeah, yeah.  A prototype of user interface.  My background is in electronics engineering.  I knew nothing about the bees, but I worked with  the bees in the end, when it came to user  interface, what I did was my system by python interface  will generate an automated email to every beekeeper each day,  which will give them the introduction.  OK, this is happening.  This is the temperature software is absolutely not my area.  This is something that we are trying to work on  and maybe find someone external who can do that.  Uh, if you look at the products which are out  there, some of them are not very good products, but  their user interface is quite user friendly and that actually  helps sell the product.  So this is something that we have to work on  at this point of time.  It since it was not my area, I have not  worked on any user interface.  It was just a standard email that bees were very  active.  At this point of time, this was the highest temperature,  lowest temperature.  This much was a weight gain.  A few plots attached with that email.  And that was it.  Yes.  You had a question.  Yeah, the sensors.  Does it mean by so each of the sensor boards  that you see it has a 48 megahertz processor, so  there is quite a bit of processing power available.  But the more I use this processor, the more power  I use.  So I'll have to see, in this case, the data  will be processed by each and every node itself.  It will only be transmitted.  This thing has to store it for a while and  then transmit it.  So my gateway does not require much of processing.  What it has to do is convert that lower packet  into an NBI OT packet and transmit it.  And that conversion does not take a lot of processing.  The NBI O transmitter is already there, so I don't  see there's any much extra processing involved with this gateway.  But when you make a note of is it like  a, uh custom made software that makes a no download.  The if the software will be different because one of  the systems let's say we have 10 systems.  Nine of them have lower transmitters.  One of them has NBA transmitter.  So other nine systems, they'll wake up every 10 minutes,  collect data, transmit, go to sleep.  This system with NBI OT is awake all the time  so that it receives any incoming lower packet.  Transmit it far, far further.  And when it's time for this system to collect the  data, it will collect its own data and transmit it.  So it is doing the transmission on behalf of all  of them.  That's all what it is doing.  No more questions.  OK?  Do you want me to thank hope again for this  wonderful talk for the very practical project?  And I and it has won many prices and we  thank for us." metadata={}
