page_content="Yeah, everyone else.  Uh oh.  OK, we might as well get cracking.  You hear me?  At the back, OK?  Yeah.  Excellent.  Welcome to Wednesday Day.  Um Alright.  Uh, so I've given you guys a a pre-recorded seminar  covering coordinate reference system.  That's on L MS LM SI.  Thought we'd just spend today and just specifically just go  through the assignment So you can use this for just  to ask as many questions as you as you like.  Um, hopefully there's nothing majorly scary in this moment.  It's always a little bit confronting to be asked to  apply something for the first time.  Um, but, um, let's see how we go.  Uh, with that So you've you've got a pre-recorded sem.  I think it's about 34 minutes long.  It covers coordinate reference system.  Please watch that, Uh, and in conjunction with the short  videos, uh, that are on, um, under the podcast section.  That should kind of cover what you need to know  in terms of coordinate reference systems.  And some of that might come up in the quizzes  so and I'll go, I'll I'll dip.  We'll go back to that in the second half of  semester because coordinate reference systems are really important thing, and  it's, uh it's quite good to get your head around  it.  But hopefully particularly the Jonathan.  So, um, video.  Uh, I think it's a really good kind of explanation,  something that's really quite complex.  But he may he sort of tries to put it  into sort of terminology in terms that that we understand.  Um, has anyone watched that so mass video yet?  Yeah.  Just what?  What what is, uh, what shape does, uh, so refer  to the world as being I like, and to a  potato, right.  This is why you know, this is probably the big  thing.  You need to get out of the, uh uh, reading  it.  I just like his terminology.  It's sort of like when we're talking about coordinate reference  systems and where we are on the globe.  We often think of the globe as a football or  a basketball.  It's not.  It's somewhere like somewhere between a rugby ball and a  basketball.  It's squashed, so it's kind of wider at the centre  than it is from top top to bottom.  Uh, and then it's not even round.  It's irregularly shaped.  It's shaped a little bit like a potato uh, and  then you get like, at any point of the glow.  There are irregularities in the surface, and you need to  have coordinate reference systems that deal with that.  So watch that there's a few others.  I think there's maybe, you know, in total about half  an hour's worth of video content, and it goes quite  quickly.  So it's quite good stuff in a succinct sort of  way.  So make sure you've done that.  So, um, so today is just about the the assignment.  Uh, and where we are, uh, you got a quiz  on Monday?  Uh, so and that finishes at, um, you got to  submit by 11.  55.  You've got the whole day.  It's a it's a half hour quiz.  Uh, you log in through L MS.  You get one stab at it.  So these sorts of problems that happen here, I let  people do it.  I don't know, in a tent or in the library  or something like that, and the WiFi drops out and  halfway through, you've lost your connection.  The uni kind of shrug their shoulders at that sort  of thing.  Uh, I'm not quite that mean, but hopefully you won't  have any problems, but make sure that you, you know,  you're in a good space.  You've got a good connection.  Do it in your own home.  Or, you know, somewhere here where you know that you're  not gonna be interrupted.  Uh, you've got half an hour.  There's 20 questions.  Half an hour is more than enough time to do  those 20 questions.  It's open book and it's multiple choice.  Alright, So, um, just, you know, plenty of time to  a minute and a half per question.  It's not particularly difficult.  It covers everything that we've done up to week five  so and inclusive stuff on coordinate reference systems.  And there might be aspects of SQL sort of things  that we've we've done in the labs of as well.  And the readings, you know.  So, uh, it covers quite a broad area.  It's not designed to trip anyone up, but it is  kind of designed to make sure that you're covering the  broader aspects of GIS.  So a lot of time, we're focusing on our practical  work and readings, and there's a lot of stuff behind  the scenes that we we probably don't even get a  lot of time to talk about.  But uh, most people come out of it quite well.  Uh, through the quiz.  Um, so don't stress too much, but you do need  to make sure you when you start, you've covered everything.  Easy to say, isn't it?  Uh, OK.  So next week, I find, uh, like, everyone is really  focusing on their assignments.  There's no seminar next week.  We sort of doubling up.  We're doing two things this week.  Uh, so there won't be a session at this time.  Just, you know, you can go jump straight in the  lab if you want.  Uh uh, That, uh, So this line is not relevant  to you the G7 class, but that you written assignment,  uh, is due technically speaking Friday.  The first I'm gonna leave this.  That submission date is the same, but I will give  grace on you.  I won't mark you as being late until after 11.  55 on Monday the fourth.  So you get an extra three days to get that  weekend to do some GIS if you want to.  Um, I think I've said this before that just with  written assignments, there's never ever a good reason not to  submit on time.  All right.  From a point of view of if you're sick and  all that kind of stuff.  Fine.  If your computer crashes half an hour before submission, you  W just shrugs his shoulders and says, Well, you've had  weeks to do it.  It it.  So you know, you could think about getting in.  If you're worried that something might fall over, you can  always you can submit prior and then keep resubmitting up  to the submission date.  So don't not submit, um, if you your penalty for  late submission is 5%.  Uh, and for most people, if you get this distinction,  which is 7% or 70% so it it your 5%  deduction is 57.  So it's actually quite a high.  Each day cost you quite a lot of that 70%  mark if that's what you're you're aiming for.  So it drop you down to 65 and that's that's  basically like a seven or 8% deduction on what people  not not.  No one gets 100% in anything unless it's maths.  And there is something definitively, right?  So just be, be aware it's not.  It's often not worth kind of going.  Oh, I can do some extra work and and submit  tomorrow.  And makeup, um, makeup marks.  It's actually quite hard to do that.  So just aim to get in on time.  Um, So by the fourth of September, you'll have done  45% of your assessment.  You should have a pretty good idea.  Um, of where you sit.  Um, that's the fourth of September.  Uh, there are labs for this course on Wednesdays and  Fridays.  You're welcome to come to any one of those labs  this week and next week.  If you need help, just come come along, grab a  seat.  And, uh uh, you don't have to only come to  your own your own class.  Uh, census date is the 31st of August.  Is it?  Do they wanna know what the census date is?  It's the last chance you've got to pull out basically  without committing your hard earned Aussie dollars or whatever.  Uh, so, uh, if you if you don't get through  your quiz Very well.  Uh, unfortunately, that sense of state is before, uh, your  your your first assignment.  So if you're really struggling after your quiz, you know,  come and have a chat with me.  And for some people, um, other pressures or whatever.  It can be difficult to, um, to compete with your  course with your your home life or whatever.  For whatever reason, if you're really, really struggling, that is  something that you is, is there.  So don't don't commit to the course unless you're committing  to the course.  Basically, that's my, uh, my advice on that.  If you're really struggling, you can always consider it will  be on offer next semester as well.  It's on on offer two semesters.  So if pulling out is is good for you, it's  not.  You know, there's no shame in that.  Um, OK, so just like as we go through this,  just ask if you've got any questions.  Anyone got any specific questions about this on it before.  Before I start before we really get stuck into this.  Yeah, 30 minutes, 30 minutes, 20 questions, 30 minutes.  So once you log in, he's got you got three  minutes.  You can't drop out of it and then kind of  go coming back to it.  You have to commit to your half an hour and  and if you if if it crashes halfway through and  this has happened, a few people it crash halfway through.  You can't get back in.  So you really don't want that to happen?  But, uh, if you do have problems when you are  doing something like this, your best bet is to email  me straight away because I can check it and all  that kind of stuff.  And if you are part way through, then then usually  there's a way that we can we can get you  to restart it.  Um, OK, so the basics, um with assignment written assignment,  just read very carefully and follow the instructions.  This is the the bleeding obvious, I suppose.  Just make sure that you've read through it thoroughly.  I've tried to be as specific as I can.  If there's bits of it you don't understand, come back  to me and I can always update those instructions sheets.  If we If we get questions about the same thing  over and over again, then obviously, our our instructions aren't  that clear.  Uh, you're the first group to do this assignment in  this format.  Uh, so, uh, you know, I?  I try to make it as specific and clear as  I can.  I don't always get that right.  Um, so important things I.  I gave you a whole page of reading suggestions and  context in lab gamma.  Um, with it both the written assignments.  You do.  I do expect you to have read.  I do.  II.  I do see from this group from time to time  submitting reports with no references whatsoever.  All right.  And honestly, from a marking perspective, that is incredibly disappointing  for masters students.  I expect you to read around this subject and and" metadata={}

I do see from this group from time to time  submitting reports with no references whatsoever.  All right.  And honestly, from a marking perspective, that is incredibly disappointing  for masters students.  I expect you to read around this subject and and  put in, uh, relevant, um, relevant references.  Uh, the other thing is just, you know, read the  rubric.  So we've given you information.  On what content or what sort of level, uh, of  information provision.  We need for you to get good marks.  And and obviously, if you get bad marks, So if  you're not referencing your spelling mistakes, you're referencing stars are  incorrect.  You're not answering the question.  Then you you know you're not gonna do that.  Well, so address the question.  Look at the rubric and also the weighting.  So the sections are fairly evenly distributed in terms of  marks.  But just make sure that you're checking out if you're  spending a lot of time on one thing, and it's  only worth 5% you know, move on to something else.  It would be my suggestion.  Um, OK, in terms of how to go about things  if you get stuck, uh, we've got, uh, almost two  weeks, uh, just shy of two weeks to to submission.  Use the forums and the troubleshooting with, uh, assignments.  If you want to email me normally, my response will  be please post on the forum.  I don't like to give answers to one person when  it comes to an assignment.  So if you post on the forum, I'll tell you  what I can tell everyone else.  All right?  So please post on the, um, on the forums.  Uh, but, you know, feel free to contact me if  if you need to.  That's fine.  Particularly if you feel you're struggling.  We can have a chat and see if we can  help you out some way.  Um, manage your input data sets effectively again.  This is one of the things where people fall over,  um, particularly on our machines that you've got you working  on a project on C Drive and you've got some  on H and some elsewhere and all this kind of  stuff.  Just try and compartmentalise all of your information, your project  files together in the same place.  It's a lot easier.  And this is just part and parcel of GIS.  It's a frustration to all of us, I think, who  work in it.  And when you're doing project work, you often have to  move your project from one you know, one machine to  another.  In an ideal world, you've got a really dedicated server,  and you always have that in the in the right  place.  But I guarantee that, like even doing what I do  using some really big data sets, uh, off the UW  a servers that we've paid a lot of money for.  It still works better on my machine.  So I end up copying stuff down to my own  machine, do the processing there and then back it up.  I do the same that that you guys have to  do.  It's just the way it is.  So that, and that's just because, like, there's a what  we call latency.  If you're working off your hard drive and you ask  questions, it's the information.  Doesn't have to travel very far.  If you've got your project on your machine, Uh, and  your data is on H drive.  It's it's the latency and the actual connection.  Uh, speed can be slow.  Uh, if you're still saving and working directly off H  drive, you will max out your space in there as  part of this This, uh, lab when you get through  lab Gamma, uh, and lab Delta.  So and it someone, you'll stick your hand up and  say my process isn't working, and it's not working because  there's no space left, Basically, so just be aware of  that.  Um so the the added attributes that you put in  lab Delta uh, Quarles Z scores all that sort of  stuff.  So part of this exercise towards the end, the last  section really is about It's an observational process.  We're asking you to We've given you an essay.  Two.  Everyone should have a different essay.  Two.  And we're asking you to describe the vegetation and land  use characteristics of that.  That area um, you.  So what I'm after is I want you guys to  be able to describe your S a two.  Does it have a high level of tree canopy overall?  Where does it sit in the scheme of things?  How mu How is the land use split up.  What percentage?  Um, can it be covered?  Does each land use um provide?  So where where have we covered this before?  Done it in the labs.  Where?  Where do we talk about it?  Hurley.  Hurley paper.  Right.  It's all about this type of thing.  So this isn't really it's not quite the same as  a by variate correlation.  It's a it's information provided for the general public or  government government users.  It's not.  We're not looking for statistical relevance.  It's just a statement of fact as to what's on  the ground.  Read what he said.  He he focuses on Butler, I think, and make some  comments about Butler as to why it's very low, all  that sort of stuff.  So again, like read around it and try and work  out why your S a two is good or bad  or whatever.  In terms of tree canopy, it might be very vanilla.  It might be right bang smack in the middle, and  that that might be all that you've got to got  to say about it.  But you need to put your S a two in  the context of everything else.  Does that make sense?  So it's not a statistical kind of examination.  It's just, uh we're just trying to get you to  think and look and see and observe and try and  work out what's important about, uh, about the distribution of  tree canopy in your S a two.  And then we want you to present a lot of  that on one page.  So this is your mapped outputs and your graphs on  the same page.  Right?  So one page graphs on the following page is not  what I want.  I want it all on one page so you can  create graphs in excel or whatever.  Push them out as an image and then insert them  into your, uh, into your map.  So you're trying to create just a one page information  sheet a little bit like Hurley did.  Really?  So if you wanna if you wanna push the boat  out on that and look at other, uh, other things  or you know where your S a two sits in  relation to anything else that's that you can do all  of that.  I'm gonna leave that to you to be creative on  that one.  so we're gonna Our suggestion is that you push everything  out.  Uh, to excel like we've done in class.  Excel is usually quite intuitive to most people have used  it a little bit.  If you've used R or any other statistical software, Fine.  I don't I don't mind.  I'm just It's just the, uh it's just the outputs  that we're, um we're interested in, uh, use your mapping  interface to help you.  Uh, What I mean by this, is is if you're  creating a data set, don't just dump it all into  your on your screen in one colour.  Have a look at it.  Colour it up.  Me, You know, uh, thematically map your vegetation cover or  your sea for indices or whatever.  Just make sure if you see lots of holes in  your data that you're not expecting.  Um So one of the things where people had a  few problems is doing tabular joints, particularly when we're talking  about the land use.  Um, if you look closely, you map up your output  by land use two, which is our reclassification land use.  If you've got lots of white holes in your dataset,  it means that your your joint process hasn't worked properly.  So use that mapping interface to help you the other  thing" metadata={}

Um, if you look closely, you map up your output  by land use two, which is our reclassification land use.  If you've got lots of white holes in your dataset,  it means that your your joint process hasn't worked properly.  So use that mapping interface to help you the other  thing you can do.  If you're trying to check a join, what's it has?  What's the other step we can take?  If you want to check that, our join has work  properly.  Attribute table, open the attribute table and look at those  last two columns.  If they're blank or you know, only partially filled, then  something has gone wrong.  That's why we do that.  We do a two step thing with it.  Temporarily check it open.  Attribute table, Go.  Oh, yeah, Every field is populated.  That's great.  Um, if you then So when we're talking about is  two.  I hope it makes sense from the labs.  You map it up on the individual values.  If you have more than 12 or fewer than 12,  then something's gone wrong in that in your table somewhere.  So I just check that out.  Um, so I do want you to use that land  use to value when it comes to your, um, your  assessment of land use or canopy by land use.  Um, so that's your symbology is really important.  And and checking your attribute table is also really important.  If it doesn't look quite right, it probably isn't right.  Um, a lot of what we've been doing is really  about this kind of joining process, joining two tables of  information together.  And if you're not getting that right, it's gonna kind  of make you fall over a little bit or quite  a bit even.  Um, OK, so waiting and rubric, that's all spelled out  in the instructions.  The waiting table on the right hand side and the  rubric, the high distinction, distinction, credit and so on should  tell you, uh, kind of the things to look out  for.  If you're not clear on that yet, I just ask.  Um, OK, so this is what we've asked for, uh,  background tree canopy in residential areas, population and dwelling density  in residential areas.  Determinants of tree canopy cover in residential areas, tree canopy  by land use.  So that's what I talked about before.  What's different about those first or points?  2 to 4 from what we've done in class?  Women dwellings.  Yeah, we didn't do dwellings.  Yeah, I've given out information.  It's in the so in the mesh box data set.  What else is different?  Flow charts.  Um, that's we're asking you to describe it that way,  but in terms of the the analysis that you're doing.  What's different?  Yeah, Yeah, only residential areas.  All right, where have you seen this before?  The which Which one?  Not Hurley.  Hurley did all jus.  OK, you've seen it all before.  So, um, I'll leave that on with you, but very  specifically, tree canopy in residential areas, dwelling density in residential  areas, um, and the determinants of tree canopy in residential  areas.  So this is a different exercise.  It's not a matter of repeating what we've done in  class.  You need to think about what that means and spatially  that's gonna change your outputs.  Uh, the S a two is still a kind of  unit of aggregation.  Um, but we're not considering everything anymore.  So you gotta work that out.  And it the residential area is what the A BS  says is a residential area.  And that's, I think, reasonably clear or quite clear in  the in the instructions.  Um, you just gotta work that out.  That's the challenge.  The person the, um, some of the places that Yeah.  So you got there's got to be some sort of  spatial spatial matching.  So, um, ultimately, if you don't have tree canopy data,  you can't do it.  Yeah, yeah.  So you got to try.  You've got to try and match those those up as  best best you can.  Yeah, And that that's again.  There's a little bit of a challenge there.  So, you know, similar similar steps we've had of a  whole bundle of SATS that don't quite match up for  C A to, uh, tree canopy data.  We're just gonna have to do that with, uh, with  all this before, so I wouldn't be.  I don't want you to be scared of this.  There's nothing really, uh, difficult.  There's about two extra steps in there that you need  to kind of think about and and and rationalise and  then put into a flow chart.  So, um, I have remarked on this a few times  that when I see people going through this class, there  are some people who fastidiously make notes and other people  who don't even bring a pen and a bit of  paper to class.  Right.  So, um, when I learnt G, I, um it was  all pen on paper stuff and I found myself drawing  lots of diagrams like it's a matter of kind of  when you're thinking about space and GIS.  It's a flow of information.  Start here.  Did this process got this?  Um, this output.  So, um, the rumbold or sorry, Humboldt.  Uh, video.  Uh, we've asked you to do flow charts.  Um, my suggestion is you have watched that video.  It's quite useful.  Basically, in GIS you have input data sets, you have  processes, you have parameters.  Uh, and then you have output data sets.  And this image on the right hand side is from  the Ezri model builder.  This is a They have a gooey interface.  If you're building a model, you build it with coloured  boxes.  Start here.  These are the steps, and you get your output.  Um, and it's when you kind of think about it.  It's quite a good way of thinking about G ice.  It's not.  It's often not a This isn't a completely linear process.  We've got vegetation going in here and roads going in  here.  So, uh, when I asked for a flow an annotated  flow chart, I do not want big boxes with an  arrow like and half a you know, half a page  paragraph and an arrow to the next step.

I've I've used this sort of structure quite a bit  just because I've learned my GIS in In art.  Just there's a There's a similar tool in a just  called graphical model.

page_content="I see people going through this class, there  are some people who fastidiously make notes and other people  who don't even bring a pen and a bit of  paper to class.  Right.  So, um, when I learnt G, I, um it was  all pen on paper stuff and I found myself drawing  lots of diagrams like it's a matter of kind of  when you're thinking about space and GIS.  It's a flow of information.  Start here.  Did this process got this?  Um, this output.  So, um, the rumbold or sorry, Humboldt.  Uh, video.  Uh, we've asked you to do flow charts.  Um, my suggestion is you have watched that video.  It's quite useful.  Basically, in GIS you have input data sets, you have  processes, you have parameters.  Uh, and then you have output data sets.  And this image on the right hand side is from  the Ezri model builder.  This is a They have a gooey interface.  If you're building a model, you build it with coloured  boxes.  Start here.  These are the steps, and you get your output.  Um, and it's when you kind of think about it.  It's quite a good way of thinking about G ice.  It's not.  It's often not a This isn't a completely linear process.  We've got vegetation going in here and roads going in  here.  So, uh, when I asked for a flow an annotated  flow chart, I do not want big boxes with an  arrow like and half a you know, half a page  paragraph and an arrow to the next step.  You wanna be thinking about something like this and then  annotate it to the side.  So So that we're clear on that.  You understand what you're what are you doing?  Has anyone used flow charts a lot for their work,  work or study?  No.  Just, um Well, hopefully it's not too, uh, too difficult.  Um, the humboldt.

So the incoming data sets in here are all in  blue, and then they're derived, and the final outputs are  in green.  There's a bit of flexibility in how you do that,  but just try and be consistent on your how your  diagrams are made.  Um, this is, uh, a lab from the end of  last year.  So, uh, instead of giving students instructions written in a  written form that we give them to you, which can  be quite lengthy, we just gave them a diagram and  told them to to do it.  And most students actually found that reasonably easy to kind  of get through.  So combining two input inputs and input and an overlay  clip and so on selections.  It's a very time effective and kind of space effective  way of describing your processes.  So when it comes to creating flow charts for this  assignment, um, I don't want you to tell me how  to use Q.  SI don't need to know that I have to open  up the attitude table, open an edit session add a  new field, all that sort of stuff.  I just need the basic steps.  I don't need to know how to calculate area dollar  area.  Uh, if you need to, you could say you need  to recalculate area.  That's fine.  But you don't just you're writing it for someone who  knows how to use qs already.  All right, so you don't need the It's not meant  to be a Q instruction manual.  It's a process flow So that you guys, you know,  with your knowledge, a curious you should be able to  pick it up and, uh, and go with it, go  with the flow.  Um, so the one page summary is Yeah, my my  strong advice on this is to go back and have  a look at the Hurley paper.  Uh, and and some of these links here, um, there's  a link to our call dashboard in there.  Some quite useful stuff about bench marking and so on  how they've done that for these types of things, that's  all in lab gamma.  So go and have a look at that.  Um, Now, this is kind of, um, just to reiterate  what I mean by just get as you're going through  your steps.  You can get quite a bit of information just by  using your mapping interface.  Um, so we we did a filtering exercise of this.  We started off here looking at tree canopy cover, and  then we we did.  We were looking for, uh, polygons that had over 90%  data coverage.  And then it ends up knocking out quite a few  of these areas up here and to the north because  they're on the periphery of the study area.  Still in class, I I'm seeing people working with this  data set, right?  And and so, if you're once you got to that  GR 90 version which we're using as an input, it  doesn't look like this anymore.  So you should.  Every time you're picking something to go in to have  a look at it.  Just make sure Is it like you?  Is it showing you what you expect to see if  you're using that data set as an input you've missed,  You've missed the step.  All right.  Um, that's, uh, again you can use excel for this  or whatever software.  Um, you need to do, uh, examinations of everything that  goes into the the model.  So you want a kind of a Pierson's correlation table  for everything?  Um, what's wrong with that graph?  Top right hand corner, Ross?  No units of measurement.  Yeah.  You had title?  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Per IRS?  D doesn't mean anything, right?  Don't use acronym acronyms and don't use column or or  data sets to label things, make sure everything you put  in makes sense to, uh, to someone who hasn't done  this class.  All right, so, um, just be careful on that so  often.  What?  You know, what we give you in the lab notes  is just is an exclamation of pro or sorry.  An explanation.  A process?  Uh, you know, that would be the, um, the field  that went into my data set this truck cover whatever,  but, um, make sure you give them proper titles.  Um, map layouts.  Just make sure that you're putting all the necessary map  inclusions in including your photo student number.  Date.  Um, metadata.  Again.  This is when it comes to this.  These legend items, um, make sure that you're using words  not, uh, not field names in here.  Um, lots of different, um scale bar options North.  A options you can play around with all that stuff.  You know, try to use this as an opportunity to  be creative in your map making, um you don't really  You need a numeric scale on your topographic map.  You don't really need it on your thematic map.  So it starts to kind of lose a bit of  meaning there.  So this, um, this 1 to 250,000 value actually relates  to the item properties.  It's it's a scale bar.  So it added as a scale bar.  And then you make the star numeric, and that should  confirm to you whether or not your map LA is  in the right scale.  I think most people are kind of on top of  all that stuff.  But you don't need the numeric scale for thematic maps.  It's just too much.  It's not really relevant for that type of mapping.  Um, OK, so for all your maps, uh, mapping is  very time is a time consuming process.  I'm sorry about that.  It just is, um so don't spend a lot of  time making a nice map and then just compress it  into a quarter of a page or half page.  Use a full a four page for every map.  Uh, and that means that you when I say full  a four page, I don't mean push the margin of  your map to the edge of the page.  I mean, you know, set your margin up in your  map layout when you're putting it into word.  Assuming that's what you're using, you need to adjust the  margins in your word document.  So if you're dealing with your A 41 to 250,000  scout and you don't adjust the margins, it will compress  your map.  And as soon what happens then, once that a four  map is compressed.  If I've got a scale is wrong, Yeah, So you  just need to make sure when you're doing that, uh,  so I don't want to see excessively large margins.  So in a as a default, you kind of end  up losing 30% of your map area through the through  the standard margins, uh, figure numbers and titles inside the  map as well.  Not on the previous page.  They gotta be in your map.  So you might have to think about that when you're  setting up the titles.  Do not rotate maps in your page you can put  a you can put a landscape map in.  That's fine.  But you have to reorientate your page.  I can't mark that.  It gives me a headache and you will not get  good marks if you rotate your maps.  Um, can't twist my screen around enough to be able  to see it.  Right.  Um, any questions?  That's all.  The kind of nitty gritty specifics.  Is anyone really stressed about this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't be stressed.  You've done everything that you need to do.  Uh, OK, ok, alright, so just a few more things.  So the referencing, um format is the a P A.  There are full guidelines on the A P a on  the UW a website.  Um, please write in English, Australian English, Uh, we use  SS, not Zs.  Please try to get that bit right.  I know that's annoying for some people because you're used  to using Zs, but, uh, these are the standards, uh,  in terms of referencing, do not reference lab notes, podcasts,  and do not reference me unless it relates to some  to something that, uh, a publication that I'm involved in.  So I don't just reference it to Alex Lab Gamma  2023.  I see it in reports from this group.  Not you specifically, but I have seen it before, right?  And it doesn't impress me, really, But it's just lazy.  Uh, all right, um, so in terms of your referencing  style," metadata={}

And it doesn't impress me, really, But it's just lazy.  Uh, all right, um, so in terms of your referencing  style, you literally can go to the UW a guidelines,  and you'll see all of this text.  You have your parenthesis style, um, your in in text  citations or your narrative style parentis style author, name and  date Smith 2014 or narrative style.  Where you put the narrative means that Duncan brackets 2020  said La da da That's a narrative style, whereas Parent  Star means that you you're essentially putting it at the  end of the sentence.  Um, I see this.  I see this quite a bit In terms of referencing  style.  This top line is incorrect.  Finish a sentence full stop and then put the, uh,  the reference and then start a new sentence.  It's it's just wrong.  I see that a lot.  I don't know why the approach should be.  You have your sentence brackets and then the full stop  and then you start a new sentence.  So keep your reference in inside the same um, same  sentence.  I don't I don't I don't quite understand why that  is.  That error is made quite frequently.  Uh, tablet formats.  Um, don't screen dump from XL.  Um, make sure that your, uh, your tables will have  a name and a title, A number and a title.  Um, with numbers, we're measuring hectares and percentages.  Um, the best thing to do is to write a  line.  Everything.  If you're dealing with numbers and decimal places, we don't  really need any more than one decimal place for this  type of information.  Um, if you're dealing with, uh, Pearson's our values and  all that sort of stuff, you might go to three.  But for for normal stuff, Um, yeah, I don't need  to know.  Fractions of a person per hectare down to four or  five decimal places.  It's too much.  We're talking about a finger or a fingernail.  So point, you know, one decimal place is OK.  Scary.  Um, if you're presenting someone else's data, um, you need  to reference it.  You're not gonna present anyone else's data just doing it.  And so you don't need to reference anything in the,  uh, in the tables.  Um, diagrams for this in the next, uh, next assignment,  you're going to create your own diagrams.  You I just There's not enough word allowance or space  allowance for you to do that.  It's kind of pointless.  I don't really need you to put diagrams from anywhere  else into your, um into your reports and images and  maps as well from somewhere else.  I.  I don't need to see those.  So please don't ever put someone else's map in a  GIS report that you submit to me any maps you  make yourself.  Um, so in terms of images, uh, when it comes  to the next assignment, uh, lots of people like you'll,  you'll be allocated, uh, a species.  And people often like to put an image of that  species in.  And that's fine.  Um, but with anything like this, you kind of need  to look at copyright like just taking something off the  Web.  And even if you reference it, if they people have  said they don't haven't given you a copyright or Creative  Commons copyright, you shouldn't really be using it.  So just generally that's something to be careful of.  You can't take, you can't take a screen grab from  just anywhere, and, um and put it in a publication.  I mean, we probably we probably do that in a  Lexa slides quite a bit.  So, um, in terms of anything you're potentially going to  publish as well.  Copyright is really important.  Um, that applies to data as well.  So the data that we've got that we're using a  BS data and DPLH data, it all comes with a  copyright.  All right, so you need to reference the data.  So I've said, um, start from that GR nine data  set, But you need to kind of reference back to  what that actually is.  Um, that's and acknowledge those people.  Uh, you should also reference software, Excel, Q.  Things like that really need to be referenced as well.  Uh, just, uh is is kind of compiled by lots  of people offering their time.  And they do ask that when you use it that  you just cite it, and that's just kind of they  they let you have it for free.  So it's always good to to reciprocate and make sure,  particularly again, if you're publishing, uh, just a good kind  of practise to get to get into so that you  use, you know, if you've used excel.  It's Microsoft or whatever.  Uh, so I reference that information as well.  Um, all of this is in the guidelines, I think,  possibly apart from that software, uh, chat GP T No  one's ever heard of chat GP T So don't use  it as my advice.  You're allowed Uni does allow you to use chat GP  T like they allow you to use Wikipedia.  Um can be very precarious if you start to take  text out of chat GP T.  It's pretty obvious to us when when you're doing that,  So don't just don't It doesn't come up with good  references and all that sort of stuff.  Um, and tends to be quite generic in what It  it it, uh, what it creates.  So I'm sure that's gonna get better.  And over time, the challenge of being out of market  gets harder.  But turn it in.  Whenever you guys submit anything to me, turn it in.  Tells me a lot about whether that your paragraph has  been used somewhere else.  If if it's taken out a previous report for this  course or someone else submits it with the same kind  of structure you you can get caught on it.  And quite often people do get caught and it costs  you quite a lot.  You'll probably down to a minimum pass as an app.  You know, like best case scenario if you're caught cheating.  So I know none of you are going to do  that, but just a warning.  Just don't, Right.  Um I don't mind you Using it for reference is  often, you know, Wikipedia is often a good place to  start.  It's not a good place to reference on.  Just it's like referencing out a lab, notes it it  to someone who's marking your paper.  If you're referencing Wikipedia, it just does nothing other than  sort of suggest laziness.  All right, uh, so I use it as a starting  point and delve delve deeper, which is useful.  I use it a lot myself, but, uh, I've never  used it as a reference.  OK, so that's the assignment, Christians.  No, I must have made it too easy.  Uh, OK, just a few things.  Um, we've got a few minutes.  So in class, uh, the the there's a number of  sort of things that kind of pop up, one of  which is the, um, the tabular joints.  Um, when you do a tabula join you?  I've talked about this left hand side of the joint  and the right hand side of the joint.  So for us, normally this this this is just an  example out of a book that happens to use land  use codes and so on.  But so on the left hand side, we have a  land use code.  This might have 55,000 records, a little bit like our  data set.  What they do is they create a look up table,  which has their 12 descriptions, or the 57 descriptions.  The reason you're doing it that way is that it's  a lot easier to calculate 57 records on the right  hand side than to go through 55,000 records here.  So you do it.  You basically just put in that relationship between this land  use code and what it's called.  You do that on the right hand side.  It's it's called normalisation.  Uh, it's just reducing" metadata={}

This might have 55,000 records, a little bit like our  data set.  What they do is they create a look up table,  which has their 12 descriptions, or the 57 descriptions.  The reason you're doing it that way is that it's  a lot easier to calculate 57 records on the right  hand side than to go through 55,000 records here.  So you do it.  You basically just put in that relationship between this land  use code and what it's called.  You do that on the right hand side.  It's it's called normalisation.  Uh, it's just reducing the table to its minimum size,  and it's really common in database, um, database management.  So you just your unique and allowable values for your  land use type are defined on the right hand side  and Then when you do the join, every one of  the 55,000 records over here will be attributed with the  land use type on the left hand side.  You're just basically just pulling that information over and in  your output output table.  We started with two columns on the left and two  on the right and output table for our, um, our  land use will now be 55,000 rows, but it will  have an extra two, in fact, three columns.  It brings the fit over as well.  That's all that is.  That's all that you're you're doing.  It's, uh it probably doesn't seem like a time saving  exercise.  But the if you think about the the alternative to  classifying 55,000 records, you have to pick every incoming, um,  eventuality, which were these 57 ways of describing, um, is  much quicker to do it using that look up structure.  Um, and you you what are the two things that  need to to be true for a joint to work  the type?  What does the type mean?  Yeah, string or number.  So, um, you're very, very rarely almost never.  In fact, would you use a real number like area  for a for a cha to join.  Why wouldn't you use a A real number?  Sorry.  Decimal places.  Yeah, like you might.  So, depending on the structure of the the the field  type, some decimal places can allow.  Sorry, some real numbers might have six decimal places.  And then on the other side, it might only have  three, and then it's it's so close, But it's not  exactly the same.  And it did so if you're ever looking to join  on, um, area, it's just not gonna work.  That's not what what you're looking for.  It really should be an integer.  This is just a code value for a land use.  Um, you, In some instances, you might use the feature  identifier, but we're not for anything we're doing.  The fit is not the right field.  So for us, when we've done joins so far, we've  used land use, and it would be land use on  both sides, not land use.  Two land use two is the value we're trying to  bring in.  So you have to have land use matching with land  use.  And then the other thing is that we're joining S,  a two level data.  So you're using your S a two information on the  right and a two on the left.  So you can, um the way the a BS structures  it its data for each unique S A two that  it has a name.  It has a an 11 or main code.  They call a main code has 11 digits and a  five digit code.  All of those values are unique within that dataset, so  you can join using any of them.  But it needs to be named to name five digit  code to five digit code 11 digit code.  So, uh, that that's for the last week or so.  That's the thing most people have kind of been a  little bit unsure of, Um, some other things that come  up, uh, did anyone so with the A BS data.  So I put we start off using data The A  SGS Volume one data on T drive.  Uh, we also sort of told you where if you  want to use it to download yourself, you can go  to the A BS website and do that.  Did anyone actually do that on their own machine?  Download from the A BS?  OK, you did you did.  OK, so you might, um you might run into problems,  so just be careful.  Alright?  So keep in touch with us in class.  So, um, the version on T drive.  Um, these are the things that I don't really want  to have to kind of cule you with early in  your GIS careers because it's a bit frustrating.  Um, amongst everything else.  That's very frustrating.  But, um, the data that comes from the a BS,  it has an incorrect it it the the the geometries  have not been properly formed in the way the a  a BS has done it.  And there are geometry errors.  And you might get this message telling you that there  are geometry errors.  Um, and if you do, uh, you can There's a  tool called fixed geometries.  You can run it.  Um, the the what the geometry error is doing is  it means that some of the shapes are a bit  like a Well, if you think back to the future,  I think where they had a belt and they twist  it over.  It's a bit of kind of like a physics sort  of stuff in that you've got a a big area  that's, um, a positive area.  And then you have a loop in your polygon.  It's like a figure of eight.  So you get a component of the polygon that's a  positive area and a component.  That's a negative area.  Uh, so they're not properly constructed, and that will result  in you getting negative areas and negative density figures.  So have a look at your data.  If you've got negative areas in there, then that's what  that problem is.  And you can always just go back to the version  I put on T drive because I've fixed all those  all those problems.  Um, it's always recoverable, but you gotta know what to  do.  Um, the general solid advice.  Uh, yeah.  Please just try and avoid working, uh, directly out of  dropbox or one drive and drive that you will get  in trouble.  Um, if you are running a process and you don't  follow the tyranny of the three dots, what's the tyranny  of the three dots all about?  Sorry.  Permanent layer.  Just make sure you hit the three dots every time.  All right, so it's you.  You don't have to, but if you create, if you  don't hit the three dots and tell Q where you  want to put your layer.  It will run it as a temporary process, and the  symbol you get on the right is that this little  bug thing means you've got a temporary layer.  Once you close your project, your data will disappear.  Sometimes it's OK to do that temporarily, but you should  only ever really have a temporary layer on your in  your layer for a minute or two just to check  things worked out as you think.  And then you go, yes, make it permanent or rerun  the rerun the steps and it will also it defaults,  and it calls it Joined Layer or something like that,  which is not really very helpful to you.  So you want to think about your layers having meaningful  names." metadata={}
